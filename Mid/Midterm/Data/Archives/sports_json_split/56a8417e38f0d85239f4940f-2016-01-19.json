The faculty and staff of Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and its Department of Psychiatry, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute deeply mourn the passing of our beloved and dear friend, Connie Lieber. Connie and her husband, Steve, were generous supporters and inspirational leaders in the field of psychiatry. In the early 1980s, the Liebers joined the fledgling National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression, now the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. Their support and eventual leadership made BBRF the major source of private funding for research on mental illness. In addition to psychiatric research, the Liebers generously supported other programs at Columbia University over a 20-year period; their philanthropy benefited the training of M.D. and Ph.D. students, established the Lieber Center for Schizophrenia Research, and funded the Lieber Clinic for Recovery from Mental Illness. In 2014, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons honored the Liebers with the Crown Award. The entire Columbia community extends its deepest condolences to the Lieber Family.
