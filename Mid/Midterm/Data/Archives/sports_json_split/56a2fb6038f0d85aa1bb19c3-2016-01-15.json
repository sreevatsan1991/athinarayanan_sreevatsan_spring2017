Lydia was born in New York to Theo-dore and Ruth Steinway (Davis), the youngest of six children. After attending Dalton, Putney, Smith, and the University of Chicago, she taught French for many years at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, introducing Montessori-style methods into the curriculum. Later, she translated scholarly books and articles from French and Italian with the remarkable precision and passion that she brought to every endeavor. She was married to Eric W. Cochrane, noted professor of Italian history at the University of Chicago (died 1985). They lived in Chicago and Florence, Italy. An active member of the Fortnightly of Chicago, Tuesday Ladies, and two book groups, she swam in the early morning with friends and attended season subscriptions to almost everything Chicago has to offer. She is survived by her sons John and Nicholas, their wives Elizabeth Fama and Ginger Gregory, grandchildren Sally, Eric, Caleb, Jean, Lydia, and Sam, all of whom knew her as a deep friend, and a large Steinway/Davis/Cochrane clan. She was intelligent, inquisitive, open-minded, decisive, self-reliant, elegant, and infinitely complex. A memorial service will take place in Chicago in the early spring. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-15T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  COCHRANE, LYDIA GOODWIN (STEINWAY)"}, "print_page": "28", "snippet": "COCHRANE--Lydia Goodwin (Steinway). 87, died in Chicago on January 5 of cardiac arrest, surrounded by family.
