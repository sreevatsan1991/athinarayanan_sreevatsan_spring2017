(March 19, 1969 - June 7, 2016) of Hawthorne lost her battle against cancer on June 7th at 7:52pm. She was a graduate of the Horace Mann School in 1987 and attended Barnard College at Columbia University. She acquired her Masters in Special Education and became a schoolteacher, where she devoted her time to teach underprivileged kids. She strived to make an impact in the world, and fought all ideas of convention. Being different is what she was good at, and she was loved and appreciated for that. She is survived by her mother Thelma, her sister Sharon, her brothers Philip and Paul, her nephews Richie and Jaxon, and her niece Stephanie. She was the godmother to Robert, Joel, and Johana, and friend to their mother Wendy, all whom loved her dearly. She was loved and taken care of by her boyfriend Richard, who was by her side till the end. On Sunday, June 26th there will be a reception at the River Palm Terrace in Fair Lawn to celebrate her life and remember her for the wonderful human being that she was. We ask that in lieu of flowers, the funds get redirected in the form of a donation to the American Cancer Society, to support those that continue fighting this arduous battle. Her spirit, her thirst for life, her unconditional love, and her genuineness will keep her memory alive in our hearts for eternity. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-12T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  BABOULIS, ALEXANDRA RITA"}, "print_page": "28", "snippet": "BABOULIS--Alexandra Rita.
