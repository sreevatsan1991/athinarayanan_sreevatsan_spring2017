The Board of Directors, Overseers and staff of the International Rescue Committee are deeply saddened by the loss of Andrew Grove, innovative business executive, champion of refugees, and valued longtime member of the IRC board of directors and IRC Overseers. A survivor of the Nazi Holocaust and the 1956 Soviet invasion of his native Hungary, Andrew was resettled in the U.S. as a refugee by the IRC in 1957. He was elected to the IRC Board of Directors in 1999 and became an IRC overseer in 2004. His foundation is the founding supporter of the IRC's Pathways to Citizenship program, which helps resettled refugees and other legal immigrants achieve U.S. citizenship. Andrew was one of ten distinguished refugees who were honored by the International Rescue Committee at the 2010 Freedom Award Dinner, where he spoke passionately about the meaning of citizenship. We express our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Eva, a fellow refugee; his two daughters and eight grandchildren; and to his entire family. International Rescue Committee Katherine Farley and Tracy R.
