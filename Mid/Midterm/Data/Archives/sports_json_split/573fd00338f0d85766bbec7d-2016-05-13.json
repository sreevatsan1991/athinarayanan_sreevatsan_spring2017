After attending the Brearley School and graduating from Milton Academy and Smith College, she received her MA in English literature at New York University. Throughout her impressive career, Margaret taught literature and writing at varied institutions of higher learning, especially enjoying her unique courses at Bard College. Her many accomplishments demonstrated her creativity and her love for the arts and literature. A teacher, writer, editor, and arts critic, Margaret's diverse art and cultural essays were published in numerous art journals.

She spent most of her life in NYC, but loved to travel and spent six years living in Italy. Margaret was actively involved in her club, the Century Association. In 1981 she married Piero Mannoni; they separated in 1993. She is survived by her siblings, Jim and Ann, and her step-daughters Francesca and Alessandra.
