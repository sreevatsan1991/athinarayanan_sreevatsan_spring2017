Joie passed away peacefully in her sleep on March 17, 2016. She devoted herself tirelessly to her family and friends, maintaining vibrant relationships with loved ones from New York to New Zealand. Charming, lively, and warm, she loved to entertain and hosted countless memorable dinners and parties. Joie's natural style, modern elegance, and impeccable taste in fashion, wine, and food inspired everyone who knew her. A lifelong athlete, she swam and ran competitively in her youth and enjoyed passions for tennis and hiking. Before the birth of her children, she studied French at La Sorbonne, graduated from UCLA, and sold mainframe computers for IBM in its heyday. She lived with her family in San Francisco and Washington, DC before settling in her beloved New York City. A loving mother, Joie was a committed volunteer, organizer, and fundraiser for each of her children's schools. In spite of a rare illness, she lived her life to the fullest with grace, courage, tremendous humor, and a prodigious sweet tooth. She spent her last days with family, enjoying favorite movies, stories, champagne, and See's chocolates. Her spirit and vitality are deeply missed.
