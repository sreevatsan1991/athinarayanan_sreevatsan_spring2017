Bernard in his 104th year: sorrow that his unique presence is no longer ours to experience, and gratitude for the extraordinary length of his years. His devotion to our Congregation was made manifest in many ways over multiple decades. His active presence on our Board of Trustees for more than fifty years was almost without precedent, and his service as Secretary to the Congregation was the longest in the Temple's history.
