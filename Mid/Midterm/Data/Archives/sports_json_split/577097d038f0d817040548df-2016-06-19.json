A noted art critic, beloved teacher, and poet closely associated with second generation of the New York School, Bill was the author of more than 20 volumes of poetry and his art writing appeared Artforum, Art in America, Aperture, Modern Painters, and other publications. Son of journalist and publisher Seymour Berkson and fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert, Bill attended Trinity School and graduated from Lawrenceville in 1957. He dropped out of Brown after his father died and committed himself to poetry while taking Kenneth Koch's course at The New School for Social Research in 1959. Bill moved to Bolinas, near San Francisco, in 1970, where he taught regularly in the California Poets in the Schools Project. From 1984 to 2008, he was on the faculty of the San Francisco Art Institute, teaching art history and literature. In June 2004 Bill underwent a successful double-lung transplant. The family is grateful to the Pulmonary Division at UCSF for giving us all these past twelve years with him. Berkson is survived by his wife, Constance Lewallen; son Moses Berkson and daughter Siobhan O'Hare Mora Lopez from his first marriage, to Lynn O'Hare Berkson; stepchildren Jonathan Lewallen and Nina Lewallen Hufford; and six grandchildren. Memorial services will be planned for San Francisco and New York. Donations may be sent to the Foundation for Contemporary Arts and Poets in Need. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-19T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  BERKSON, BILL"}, "print_page": "22", "snippet": "BERKSON--Bill, born in New York City in 1939, died Thursday in San Francisco at age 76.
