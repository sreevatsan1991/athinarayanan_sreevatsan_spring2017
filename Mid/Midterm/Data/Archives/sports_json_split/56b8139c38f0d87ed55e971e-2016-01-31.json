Richard A. \"Buz\" Cooper, MD, a pioneering cancer research scientist who became one of the world's leading authorities on physician supply and the causes of healthcare disparities, died peacefully at home in New York City on January 15, 2016. During more than 50 years as a physician-scientist, Dr. Cooper had a distinguished and diverse career. He began his clinical and investigative training in hematology and oncology in the 1960s at the National Cancer Institute and Boston City Hospital's Thorndike Laboratory. He later joined the University of Pennsylvania faculty as Chief of Hematology, founded the Abramson Cancer Center, and taught in the Leonard Davis Institute, both at Penn. A native of Milwaukee, Dr. Cooper returned there as dean of the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1985, subsequently founding and directing MCW's Health Policy Institute. Among the first to recognize a potential doctor shortage, Dr. Cooper was a leading authority on the economic and social dynamics underlying healthcare spending and utilization. Increasingly he studied healthcare through the lens of poverty; his book about the effect of income inequality on poor healthcare outcomes will be published by Johns Hopkins University Press later this year. He was preceded in death by his first wife, Jacqueline Cooper, and is survived by his second wife, Andrea Pastor; his current wife, Barrie Cassileth; daughter, Stephanie (David) Cooper Cornelius; son, Jonathan (Eileen Harris) Cooper; and grandchildren, Jordan, Matthew, and Halle Cooper. A memorial commemorating Dr. Cooper's life and achievements is planned for a future date.
