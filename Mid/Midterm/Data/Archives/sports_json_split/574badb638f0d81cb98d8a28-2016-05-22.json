He was 61. A devoted husband and father, Bob is survived by his wife, Frances (Bush-Brown) Thompson, and his children, Sarah M. Thompson and Augustus T. Thompson, both of New York City. He is also survived by his sister, F. Dana Thompson, of Denver, CO. Bob spent 40 years in the financial services industry, most recently as a Senior Advisor to Intermediate Capital Group, for whom he served as the Non-Executive Chairman of ICG Strategic Secondaries. Additionally, he served as a Senior Advisor/Board of Directors Member to multiple private equity general partners and a High Net Worth family office. Until 2012, Bob served as the Global Head of Alternative Investments for AIG Investments, which rebranded to PineBridge Investments upon its spinout from AIG in 2010. In this capacity, Bob was responsible for all private equity and hedge fund activities globally. Prior to AIG, Bob was a founder and Managing Partner of Ferrer Freeman Thompson & Co., LLC, a Greenwich, CT-based private equity platform.

Before joining GE Capital, Bob was a consultant at Bain & Co. in Boston, MA and a commercial lending officer at Chemical Bank in New York City, where his career began in 1976. Born in Boston, MA in 1954, Bob was raised in Andover, MA. He received an A.B. in Economics from Harvard College and an M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Bob's childhood home was proximate to the playing fields of Phillips Academy, which fostered an early and lasting fanaticism with sports. Bob was a heralded student-athlete at Berkshire School and subsequently played varsity soccer, varsity golf, and junior varsity hockey at Harvard. He excelled in golf and numerous racquet sports well into his adult years. Friends and family will remember Bob most especially for his infectious personality, dry wit, and kind-hearted nature. His balance of obvious intellect and distinct approachability facilitated enduring friendships and profound impressions on those within his personal and professional lives. He was loved by many and will be deeply missed by all. A memorial service to celebrate Bob's life will be held at 11am on Saturday, June 18 at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in New Canaan, CT.
