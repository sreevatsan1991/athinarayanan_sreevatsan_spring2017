Beloved mother, teacher and friend, passed away peacefully on January 6, 2016, after a long illness. She was at home, surrounded by her three daughters. Her charm, intelligence and wit enriched the lives of all who knew her. Born and raised in the Bronx, NY, she worked in the personnel department at the Revlon company's headquarters, and helped her brother Rico establish the New Dimension Theatre in Oradell, NJ. In the 1970's as a divorced mother of three, she entered Ramapo College, earned her bachelor's degree and then began her long, rewarding career in education. She taught drama, public speaking, English and literature at Emerson High School for 27 years, helping generations of students to find meaning in stories, to make sense of the world and to find their own voices. Beloved by her students, she was voted favorite teacher by more than a dozen senior classes. Over the years, she shared her love of travel and all things Italian with students she led on trips to Italy. She took joy in the rich process of education and was a lifelong learner herself. From the most recent archeological discovery to finding a new jazz standard; from cooking a favorite meal to alerting the family to a special moonrise, her curiosity and enthusiasm was a joy for all around her. She will be remembered for her laugh, her love of life and her fierce courage of the heart. Lillian was the youngest child of Filomena Volino Imundo and Rocco Imundo, and was predeceased by her siblings Ann, Louis, Rose and Rico. She is survived by her daughters Renata Simone of Marblehead, MA, Lauren de Simone and Stephanie Sanders of Ridgewood, NJ, and her granddaughters Lily and Roxanne Sanders. Private observances will be held. Condolences can be sent to lillydesimone@aol.com. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests a donation in memory of Lillian to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation or the charity of your choice. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-17T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DE SIMONE, LILLIAN IMUNDO"}, "print_page": "27", "snippet": "de SIMONE--Lillian Imundo.
