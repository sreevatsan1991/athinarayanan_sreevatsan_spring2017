There was no kinder a man, no more precise a mind, no more caring a person, no more pleasingly warm a writer, no more attentive a listener, and no more humbler a person.

Under his leadership, Citizens Union started its publication, www.GothamGazette.com. We will miss his gentle guidance, humor and abiding humanity.
