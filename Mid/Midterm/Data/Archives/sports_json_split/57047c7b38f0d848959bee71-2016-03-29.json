Loving mother and grandmother, dedicated wife and sister, accomplished choral singer and community stalwart died quietly in her home in Johns Creek, GA on March 24. She was born Marion Clausen in 1932 in New Rochelle, NY and attended The Northfield School and Skidmore College. After college, Marion forged a 13-year career at Time, Inc. before she met her husband Donald \"Woody\" Gray. Marion was a dedicated alumna of Time, Northfield and Skidmore, faithfully attending reunions throughout her life. An outstanding alto voice made her a wonderful addition to the Blue Hill Troupe in New York City. Her dedication to choral singing was a constant in her life, and was expressed when the family moved to Orono, MN through the Wayzata Community Church choir, the Minnetonka Choral Society and the Leagueaires, a 60-woman volunteer choral group that performs at nursing homes and for disabled children and adults. In 1991, when the family moved to Atlanta, Marion joined the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus, directed by Robert Shaw; this was the highlight of her singing career. Marion believed in giving back to the communities in which she lived. She was a tireless volunteer for the arts, hospitals and schools. She joined the Junior League and was an active member of the League's LST group. Her favorite charity was the Children's Cancer Research Fund where she worked for years. When Marion married Woody in 1967, they honeymooned in Quogue, NY, her favorite place. Summer vacations with her children created cherished memories. The memories became even more valuable as she was able to share time in Quogue with her three grandchildren, whom she adored. Marion leaves behind her husband of 49 years, Woody, son Peter (Cindy) Gray and their daughters Alexandra and Cathryn, daughter Carolyn (Malcolm) MacLear and their son Archer, her twin sisters, Joan and Jane, and innumerable friends throughout the communities she touched in her 83 years. It was her wish that in lieu of flowers, gifts could be sent to Children's Cancer Research Fund: childrenscancer.org 7301 Ohms Lane, Suite 355, Minneapolis, MN 55439. A Memorial Service will be held on Thursday, March 31, 2016 at 2pm at H.M. Patterson and Son Oglethorpe Hill, 4550 Peachtree Road, Brookhaven, GA 30319.
