She was 85. She will be remembered by family and friends as a caring wife, a loving mother, and an unapologetic partisan of the Democratic Party. Selma was born on August 13, 1930 in New Haven, Connecticut to George Kaufman and Edith Ginsberg. The Kaufmans operated a five-and-dime store where Selma helped her parents after school. Music filled the family home, where it was common for relatives to gather for impromptu Sunday afternoon concerts of Perry Como songs and other popular music, with Selma and her sister Beatrice on piano and her brother Bernard (Bernie) on clarinet. In 1948, Selma graduated from Hillhouse High School and, in 1952, from New Haven State Teachers College. She later earned a master's degree in education from the College of New Rochelle. In 1954, she married Arthur (Art) Olick, a Yale law student, and upon Art's graduation they moved to Fort Gordon, Georgia where he served in the U.S. Army for two years. Upon relocating to the New York area, Selma gave birth to a son, Robert, in 1957 and a daughter, Karen, in 1961. Art served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York under Robert Morgenthau from 1962 to 1968, following which he was a name partner at several New York law firms, most notably Anderson, Russell, Kill, and Olick. For three decades, the family lived in Hartsdale, NY, where they were active in Bet Am Shalom, a Reconstructionist temple in White Plains, and Selma worked as a part-time elementary teacher in the Greenburgh school district. Selma and Art built a weekend home in Putnam Valley where they spent many weekends with family and friends. For many years, Selma and Art traveled extensively, were avid fans of opera and classical music and were even bigger fans of spending time in both New York and Florida with their grandchildren. A child of the Great Depression, Selma never lost her innate frugality, insisting on D'Agostino's over Whole Foods and buses over Uber. She was constant in her commitment to her family's education. She also never hesitated to stop a dinner party in its tracks to highlight topical issues of racial and economic inequality. As Art's health declined due to M.S., Selma served as his caregiver and tireless advocate. None who knew her will ever forget her common decency or her uncommon impatience with the speed of social progress. Selma is survived by Arthur, Robert, Karen and her husband John Gibson and five grandchildren, Joshua, Sarah, Rachel, Stephen, and Grant. Services Sunday, April 3rd, at 11:30am at Riverside Chapel, Manhattan. Family will be receiving at 300 East 54th Street on Sunday, from 5-8pm. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-02T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  OLICK, SELMA ADA"}, "print_page": "18", "snippet": "OLICK--Selma Ada, died in New York City, NY, on March 31, 2016, of complications from heart disease.
