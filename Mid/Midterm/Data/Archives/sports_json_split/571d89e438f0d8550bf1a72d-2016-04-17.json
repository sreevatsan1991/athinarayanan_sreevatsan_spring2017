Born on a kitchen table in Queens Village, Queens in 1921 to Rebecca and Abraham Kaplan, Marcia Kaplan Nielsen died in her Upper East Side home of 60 years on March 27, 2016. Marcia graduated from Queens College before moving to Washington, DC where she met Waldemar \"Wally\" Nielsen with whom she shared an indelible bond marked by 62 years of marriage. Some of Marcia's fondest years were those she spent in Paris from 1948-1952 where Wally worked in the Marshall Plan, and where their daughter Signe was born. Marcia was an active member of the Democratic Party and an engaged volunteer in community and national organizations, but the work she was proudest of was her three decades as a college advisor at the Nightingale Bamford School. Sifting through her papers turns up letter after letter from former students who write about her impeccable style, directness, keen and level advice, and her compassion. Her daughter Signe, her granddaughter Marina, great-grandson Lukas, and many other relatives whose lives she has enriched survive her. A memorial service will be held at the Nightingale Bamford School on June 3 at 6pm.
