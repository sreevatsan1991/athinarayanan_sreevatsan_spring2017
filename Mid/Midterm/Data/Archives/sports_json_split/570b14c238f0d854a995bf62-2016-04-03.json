Born in 1929, she led a merry and well-loved life as a teacher, wife, mother, hostess, writer, gardener and editor. She embraced the dreams and encouraged the promise of everyone whose life she touched. She leaves behind generations of family and friends. Her husband Max, on the faculty of Stony Brook Medical School since 1973, appreciated Martha's warm hospitality to his colleagues and unwavering support for his work. No mother was ever prouder of her children, nor children ever prouder of their mother: Jonathan, Rachel and Linda Fink have lost their greatest sounding board, email correspondent, and cheerleader. Martha joyfully introduced decades of first and third graders of Great Neck's Cumberland and E.M. Baker schools to reading, storytelling and appreciating the natural world. Martha is also survived by Nina DeLange, Tom Dennis, Lincoln Brower, and her four grandchildren, Laurel and Andy Fink, and Rose and Hieu Dennis. The family will be at home on Long Island on Sunday, April 3rd from 1:00-6:00pm. In lieu of sending flowers, Martha would want you to plant something beautiful in your own garden. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-03T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  FINK, MARTHA GROSS"}, "print_page": "26", "snippet": "FINK--Martha Gross, died suddenly on March 31st, with her husband of 67 years by her side.
