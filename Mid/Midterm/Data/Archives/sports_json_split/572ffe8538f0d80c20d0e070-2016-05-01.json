Columbia University Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian celebrate the life and mourn the passing of Dorothy Warburton, Ph.D., professor emeritus of Clinical Genetics and Development, a pioneer in her field, and a member of our faculty since 1964. She joined Columbia as a research assistant in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and from 1969 until 2005 served as Director of our Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory. Her contributions to the field of human genetics - particularly to fetal chromosomal abnormalities - are unrivaled. Dr. Warburton was the recipient of one of the highest honors in the cytogenetics field, the 2014 Distinguished Cytogeneticist Award, and the 2006 William Allan Award, given by the American Society of Human Genetics, to recognize substantial scientific contributions to human genetics carried out over a sustained period of time.
