Martin L. Gross of New London, NH and Ocean Ridge, FL died on Tuesday, January 26, 2016 in Ushuaia, Argentina following a stroke suffered en route to Antarctica. He was 77 years old. Martin's adventures began in New York City where he was born on October 22, 1938. As a young child, Martin and his older brother, Woolf, were dispatched to summer camps and later to working cattle ranches in Utah during the summer months to escape the polio outbreaks that plagued New York City in the years following World War II. After high school, Martin headed north to Cambridge, MA where he attended both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, graduating from the latter in 1964. Before embarking on his first job as a law clerk in New Hampshire, Martin and his first wife, the late Caroline Lord Gross, purchased a Volkswagen pop-up camper and drove to Alaska with Martin's mother, Harriet. Harriet slept in the camper; Martin and Caroline slept outdoors in a tent. After several weeks of abysmal weather the camper was coated with a thick layer of adobe-colored mud. When the trio returned to Concord and washed the car for the first time, it was in pristine condition. Thereafter, Martin never worried much if his car was dirty. Following his clerkship, Martin joined the Concord, New Hampshire law firm of Sulloway & Hollis, P.L.L.C. from which he retired (while maintaining senior counsel status) in 2015 after more than 50 years of distinguished service to his clients and to the New Hampshire Bar. As with everything else in life, Martin viewed the practice of law as an adventure. He delighted in besting his adversaries and often developed long and lasting friendships with them. His in-house writing boot camps were legendary and his wit and charm were ever present at the office and in the courtroom. While working full-time as a Sulloway lawyer, Martin served three terms as the mayor of Concord. During these years, Martin developed a real talent for cooking. This was driven by necessity since Caroline's busy schedule at the State House meant she was often home late. Undeterred by a complete lack of training (and by a lifelong aversion to cookbooks) Martin channeled his inner top chef and produced thousands of wonderful meals for friends and family. The informal \"Sunday Suppers\" he enjoyed with his close friends Malcolm and Susan McLane, Liz and Dennis Hager and other dear Concord friends were a social staple. Six years after the loss of his beloved Caroline in 1993, fate intervened and Martin met his second wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, architect, New London, NH. The meeting occurred at Chicago's O'Hare Airport where both were waiting to board a flight back to New Hampshire. It would turn out to be a kismet flight on United Airlines (friendly skies indeed!) with Deirdre sitting in seat 2B and Martin (who always flew coach and never paid for upgrades) inexplicably seated in seat 3B directly behind Deirdre. Seeing that seat 2A was open, Martin leaned over and graciously asked Deirdre \"Can I buy you dinner?\" They have been having dinner together ever since. This episode gave Martin plenty of fodder for his expansive repertoire of bad puns....\"United\" Airlines.... 2B or not to be.... Martin made the most of it. Six months later, in July 2000, Martin and Deirdre were married. During their 15 year marriage, Martin and Deirdre traveled the world. Despite temporary setbacks (Martin's surgeries, lost luggage, etc.) they visited South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Central America and multiple European countries. This past September, Martin and Deirdre rented an Airstream trailer and toured Grand Teton and Yellowstone parks; they did not have to sleep outdoors. Over the past few years, one of Martin's happiest endeavors was building a warm winter getaway in Ocean Ridge, FL. He loved living in a house designed by his wife, Deirdre. Two weeks ago, Martin and Deirdre left for Antarctica; a trip that was to be Martin's last great adventure. While southbound on his way to Antarctica on a cruise ship he suffered a stroke and had to be transferred to a passing northbound vessel. That ship docked safely in Ushuaia (the cruise's point of origin) where Martin underwent surgery to relieve a subdural hematoma. Despite excellent care and a successful surgery, Martin contracted an infection from which he did not recover. Martin loved the spontaneity and unpredictability of travel. He would have appreciated the irony of his last great adventure. Martin is survived by his wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, of New London, NH; his brother, Woolf Gross (spouse Lucy) of Arlington, VA; a nephew, William Gross, of Arlington, VA; two cousins, John and Charles Gross, both of New York City, and his brother-in-law (affectionately referred to as \"hermano west,\" Hugh McCrystal (spouse Polly). In addition, Martin is survived by dozens of close friends including his childhood friend, Peter Soloman (who Martin always introduced as \"the man I've never not known\"), Will and Sherry Rogers and their two daughters, Anne and Catherine (who were Martin's goddaughters and who lovingly called him \"Uncle Martin\"), Peter and Jean Burling, Rick and Karla Karash, Alex Bernhart and Myra Mayman, Merwyn and Carol Bagan, and others too numerous to name. In honor of Martin's extraordinary service to his community, donations can be made to the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation (on whose board he served for many years), to the Capitol Center for the Arts, to New Hampshire Public Radio, or to the charity of one's choice. Funeral arrangements and information about a celebration of Martin's life will be announced at a later date. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-31T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GROSS, MARTIN L"}, "print_page": "25", "snippet": "GROSS--Martin L.
