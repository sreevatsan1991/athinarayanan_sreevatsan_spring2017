Her sudden passing has been a rude awakening as to how unfair life can be, how lucky we are for the special people in our lives and the cherished friendships we find. Terry was an adoring mother to Harry and Ruby, loving wife of Elliot, cherished sister of Gina, Jack, Mark and Dominic, magical and generous aunt, great-aunt, Godmother, cousin and sister-in-law to a lucky few, and an extraordinary friend and colleague to many. Everyone she encountered considered Terry to be their best or special friend - including the nurses, support team and doctors at Dana Farber/Brigham and Women's Hospital who gave Terry extraordinary care and granted her wish for a dignified and peaceful passing. Terry was the proud owner of the Terry Ventre Showroom in New York City which celebrated it's 25th anniversary on June 16th. She ran her business as she lived her life with the utmost integrity, positive energy and incredible passion. She was beautiful, bright, charming, stylish times 10, funny times 20, interested, interesting, compassionate and determined. She taught many of us how to be. She is already sorely missed. We suppose angels can only stay on earth for a short time. Terry loved Central Park where she ran, walked, strolled, and met loved ones for long talks. A park bench will be donated in Terry's name. In Terry's memory, donations may be made to: Centralparknyc.org/Ventre or to the American Cancer Society. In lieu of sorrow, express your love for Terry. In her words: \"Always start with yes,\" \"Be kind and respectful\" and \"Buy the bathing suit.\" As Terry requested, memorials in NYC, Nantucket, Chicago and Miami are being planned for the Fall. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-07-03T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  VENTRE, TERESE VIRGINIA \"TERRY.\" HAS PASSED AFTER AN INCREDIBLY SHORT BATTLE WITH LUNG CANCER"}, "print_page": "22", "snippet": "VENTRE--Terese Virginia \"Terry.\" Has passed after an incredibly short battle with lung cancer.
