Lorna Joyce Jorgenson Wendt of Stamford, Connecticut, passed away surrounded by her family on Thursday, February 4, 2016 due to complications associated with Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Leukemia. It was a brief illness diagnosed less than six months ago. Survived by her two daughters Sarah Wendt (Andrew Regier) and Rachel Nash (Derek Nash), and her three adored grandchildren Riley, Audrey and William. In addition, she leaves behind her loving partner of seventeen years, Spencer Dean Wallin, and her siblings Karen Rudrud, Kathy Seyberth, Ruth Nordal, Ronald Jorgenson and Rick Jorgenson, among many loved family members and dear friends. She is pre-deceased by her mother and father, Esther and J. Obert Jorgenson, and her sister Rachel Jorgenson. Born in Minot, North Dakota in 1943, Lorna spent her childhood primarily in Wisconsin. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Madison with a B.A. in Music. After living in Boston, Houston, Atlanta and Miami with her husband and two daughters, the family moved to Stamford, CT in 1975. Courageous, determined, feisty, strong and giving are words that describe Lorna's legacy and influence on many. She was a pioneer in the quest for equality before, during and after marriage. Lorna started a national discussion on fairness and equality in all relationships when her 32 year marriage ended and she publicly defended her role as an equal partner. Realizing there was a need to help others understand the many facets of equality, Lorna founded and led the Equality in Marriage Institute from 1998 until its closure in 2008. The mission of this work and the important discussions will live on through MORE, the Money, Relationships & Equality initiative at the University of Wisconsin her alma mater. This program was launched as part of the University School of Human Ecology's 4W Initiative, of which she was named Chair. Lorna had a lifelong commitment to many civic and nonprofit organizations, serving on the boards of Outward Bound International, the Stamford Symphony, and the Greenwich Choral Society. She was a founding benefactor of the Women's Philanthropy Institute, which is now a part of the School of Philanthropy at Indiana University. A lifelong musician, she taught music, sang with many choirs and was a former member of the Board of Visitors for the School of Music and the College of Letters and Science. Lorna shared her love of exploration and belief in experiential education with her family and friends, travelling the seven continents and setting foot in more than 150 countries, leaving lifelong memories. A memorial service will be held at 1pm on Saturday, February 20th at St. John's Lutheran Church in Stamford. In lieu of flowers, the family is asking donations be made to the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, the Lorna Jorgenson Wendt Legacy Fund of MORE or to the Young Women's Leadership Network. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-07T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WENDT, LORNA"}, "print_page": "20", "snippet": "WENDT--Lorna.
