One year ago today, artist Nela Arias-Misson passed away quietly in Miami, FL, a few weeks short of her 100th birthday. Born in Cuba, she studied art at the Student Arts League of New York. In the late 1950's, she moved to Provincetown to study with Hans Hofmann, the dean of abstract expressionism. She moved to Ibiza in 1961 and developed her own style.

She is survived by her daughter, Carole Bird. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-07-17T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Memorials  ARIAS, MISSON, NELA"}, "print_page": "26", "snippet": "ARIAS-MISSON--Nela.
