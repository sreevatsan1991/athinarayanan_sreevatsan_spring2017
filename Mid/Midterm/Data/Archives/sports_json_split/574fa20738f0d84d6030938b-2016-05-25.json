Visionaries can find a way to turn a privilege into a right...learning to play the piano has long been only a privilege. Fred Papert felt it should be a right for public school students, particularly in NYC. Not many people can say that they read an article about brain research and turned that experience into a program that has served more than 400,000 elementary school students in close to 300 public schools across NYC and beyond for nearly 20 years. Fred Papert did just that after a lifetime of courageous and successful projects. After reading an article in Newsweek in 1996 that mentioned the impact studying music could have on children's brain development, Fred gathered important thinkers on the subject and used his non-profit 42nd St. Development Corp. to lay the foundation for Music and the Brain. MATB is a program that continues to empower hundreds of music teachers and public schools by making learning the language of music and playing the piano/keyboard a core part of a public school child's educational week. Fred's daughter, Lisha Lercari, who has served as the Program Director for Music and the Brain along with her team members Lisala Beatty and Emina Nusbaum will forever be grateful for the positive changes he made to both the community and individual lives.
