(December 11, 1925-May 9, 2016). Patient wife, devoted, loving mother, formidable PTA leader, dedicated professional, staunch ally, savior of strays, wise counselor, and generous friend. Died peacefully after a sudden, short illness. A magnificent survivor with a kind heart, sharp eye, and a keen, independent mind. A graduate of New Jersey College for Women (Rutgers), she made her own way in publishing by intellect, dedication, and professionalism. A random meeting on July 14, 1949, introduced her to the love of her life, Sidney Fashena. They married in 1958 and she left her career in 1960 to devote herself to raising four children. She returned to work at Woman's Day magazine in 1975 and ultimately rose to Chief Production Editor before retiring in 1995. She served repeatedly as President of the Friends of the Mount Pleasant Public Library, staffing a book sale just eight days before her death. She survived the loss of her beloved Sidney in 2003 and of her younger sisters Henryetta and MaryFrances. She is survived by children David, Daniel, Sarah, and Jonathan; grandsons Zed and Aidan Fashena, Benjamin Coleman, and honorary granddaughter Victoria Joire, MaryFrances' granddaughter. Visitation will be held at the Beecher Flooks Funeral Home in Pleasantville, NY, (914) 769-0001, 7-9pm, Wednesday, May 11, and 9-10am Thursday, followed by a Celebration of Life, before she rejoins her husband in Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla.
