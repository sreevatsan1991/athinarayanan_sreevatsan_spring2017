Mary's life was most remarkable for the effect she had on the people around her. She brought light and laughter to every room she entered. A rock of comfort and support for anyone grieving or feeling lonely, Mary loved to laugh and make others laugh, play games, cook, and spend time with friends. She loved her dogs, the mountains, music, boating, reading, and traveling. But most of all, she loved her husband, John, her son, Ike, and her daughter, Lindsey. For those fortunate enough to have met her, Mary will be remembered as one of the warmest and most thoughtful people the world has known. Generous and welcoming, she opened her home to everyone-friends and strangers alike-who needed a home-cooked meal or a safe haven. She was fiercely loyal to and supportive of those close to her and kind to everyone she met. Mary's family takes comfort in the knowledge that her legacy lives on through the immeasurable impact she had on others. While the joy and laughter that her memories evoke pale in comparison to her radiant physical presence, they ensure that she will never be forgotten. It is Mary's family's hope that all who knew her will honor her memory by striving to treat others with the grace and kindness that she did. It was the size of Mary's heart that made the world a better place. A celebration of Mary's life will be held at 5pm on Saturday, January 23, at Baltimore Country Club at Five Farms, 11500 Mays Chapel Road, Lutherville, MD 21093. All friends are welcome. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary's name to Dyslexia Tutoring Program (dyslexiatutoringprogram.org). As John Irving, one of Mary's favorite authors, once wrote: \"It is hard work and great art to make life not so serious.\" In that respect, Mary was a tireless and masterful artist. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-17T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MESSMORE, MARY ANNE"}, "print_page": "27", "snippet": "MESSMORE--Mary Anne, of Baltimore, Maryland, died peacefully with her family by her side on January 11, 2016.
