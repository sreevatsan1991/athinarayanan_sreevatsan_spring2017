In loving memory of my aunt, Gertrude Kasle, of Detroit, MI and Sarasota, FL. Gertrude passed away peacefully on June 21, 2016 at the age of 98. She was born in New York City and earned a degree in art, which was her lifelong passion. After marrying, she moved to Detroit. She opened the Gertrude Kasle Gallery in the Fischer Building (1965-1978). Gertrude was a major force in the introduction of the post war New York School of artists to Michigan. Hers was the sole American gallery west of New York to show the abstract expressionists at that time. She championed many legendary artists including Guston, de Kooning and Motherwell while others were questioning their merit. She closed the gallery and moved to Florida in the 1980's. Gertrude will be missed for her loving spirit, her strength, optimism and her wonderful sense of aesthetics.
