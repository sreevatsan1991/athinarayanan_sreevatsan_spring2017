During her 82 years, Myrna touched many lives. To her husband Lenny of 60 years, she brought endless love and excitement. To her children Fred and Eileen, Jay and Lauren, Stacey and Charles, Matt and Susan she brought great love, compassion and encouragement to strive for the best and to always enjoy life. However, her grandchildren Paul, Greg, Ilana, Ryan, Madeline, Meryl, Madison and April were the joys of her life. She was enchanted by them and they by her. Myrna gave to her community and her friends throughout her life. We are all better for having known her style, grace and concern for others around her. Myrna never told us how to live a great life, she showed us. We will remember her fondly forever and ever.
