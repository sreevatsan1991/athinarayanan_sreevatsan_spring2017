He was 77 years old. Born in New York City, he was the only child of Professor T.P. Peardon Sr., a history and political science professor at Barnard College, and Celeste (Comegys) Peardon, a well-known writer of books for children learning to read. Mr. Peardon attended The Trinity School in New York City and graduated from Harvard College with the class of 1960. While at Harvard he was a member of the DU Club and The Hasty Pudding Society. Immediately after college he joined his family's firm, Brunschwig et Fils, importers of high-end French fabrics and furniture for the interior decorator trade, with showrooms in New York City and in major cities throughout the U.S. and abroad. Rising through the ranks to CEO, he retired as Chairman of the Board in 2007. He was a member of the Union Club of New York City, the Harvard Club of New York City and a proud veteran of New York's famous 7th Regiment of the New York National Guard. Although a geology major in college, he was, like his father, an avid reader of history, his favorite pastime. Fluent in French, Mr. Peardon traveled often in France visiting his company's many suppliers. In 1968, in the midst of France's national strike against President Charles De Gaulle, he celebrated his marriage to his wife Eveline Le Jemtel at her family's chateau in Normandy, right next to Omaha Beach of D-Day fame. In later years he and his wife bought and remodeled a house in Bayeux on the Normandy coast where, after retirement, they spent many happy months during the year. Mr. Peardon leaves his wife of 48 years, Eveline, his son Thomas Olivier and his wife Susannah and two young granddaughters, of Greenwich, CT.
