Jack was born in New York City, December 24, 1945, later preferring to tell folks he grew up on a small island off the coast of New Jersey. He studied at Stephens Institute of Technology and later earned his BS degree at Long Island University. Taking pre-med courses, he planned to follow in the footsteps of his deceased father, who was a NYC physician. All that changed when he took a summer job at Thomas J. Lipton company where he discovered the many faceted world of food science. His enthusiasm for food science never diminished. During his 20 year corporate career, he worked at a number of leading food companies including Best Food and Chesebrough Ponds. He gained experienced in every aspect of food processing, plant production, food safety, product development and federal filing regulations and practices. He was a trained taster who could recognize the individual spices in any combination presented, much to the surprise of restaurant chefs, a number of whom he advised and befriended over the years. As his career evolved, his focus centered on canned foods and he became one of New York's foremost food processing authorities. As such, he was a consultant who was recognized and worked with the United States Department of Agriculture and food processing. An avid sailor and scuba diver since his teens, Jack left the corporate world behind to sail from New York City to the Caribbean with a sailor buddy, exploring practically every island there during their six month cruise. Soon after his return, he formed his own company, Van Ness Food Technologies, which he operated while living aboard his 37 foot sailboat, \"Cruzin,\" docked at City Island, NY. In 1992, he found \"the love he had been waiting for\" when he met Carolyn, another enthusiastic scuba diver. They married in 2001 aboard a yacht in New York harbor. Throughout their years together, they traveled the world, lured by possible dive adventures in the Caribbean, Bora Bora, Europe, Mexico and the Red Sea. One of Jack's favorite sea stories was about his transatlantic sail aboard a 42 foot sailboat from Bermuda to Malaga, Spain. \"Sailing across the Pond is on every sailor's bucket list and I couldn't be happier or more satisfied because I got to do it,\" said Jack. Jack loved being with friends and sharing sea stories based on his experiences sailing with Carolyn up and down Long Island Sound, always on the lookout for a new raft up spot and seafood restaurant. For almost 30 years, Jack's consulting business worked with international clients in Canada, Greece, Israel and Korea. He was a featured lecturer at the First Food Safety Conference held in Bangalore, India, where he taught Indian food scientists how to implement Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point safety principles. Jack was a hands on expert who knew how to build and manage a food plant from its conception to the time the canned food product was on the pallet ready to go to market. He was known for his strong sense of integrity and absolute dedication to ensuring the safety of any food product under his production management. He was a charter member of IFTPS, participating in annual food conferences in the US and abroad. Jack was more than generous in passing along his wealth of knowledge to his many clients, interspersed with updates about his latest sailing or diving adventures. His genuine enjoyment of life was contagious. It enabled Jack to engage in lively conversations and make friends with young and old alike. With the wind at his back, he has charted his course, leaving us with memories of an unforgettable personality, sharp wit, brilliant mind and smile. Besides his beloved wife, Carolyn, he leaves behind a worldwide group of business associates and longtime friends, whose many lives he touched. At his request, his ashes are to be scattered over the area waters that gave him so much pleasure. There will be a celebration of Jack's life during the coming sailing season. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-24T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  VAN NESS, JOHN R."}, "print_page": "19", "snippet": "VAN NESS--John R.,known as \"Jack,\" 70, of Ossining, NY, died peacefully with his wife at his side, January 19, 2016, at Rosary Hill Home after a short, courageous struggle with cancer.
