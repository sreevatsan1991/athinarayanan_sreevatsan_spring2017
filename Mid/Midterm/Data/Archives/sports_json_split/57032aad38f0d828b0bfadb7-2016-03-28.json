The Horace Mann School community profoundly mourns the sudden loss of our beloved alumnus, parent and Trustee, Dominic Kulik, Horace Mann 1982. Always an active and loyal member of the HM community, particularly as a young gifted athlete and record setting - Varsity swimmer, Dominic returned to HM first as a dedicated parent and then as an active member of the Horace Mann Board of Trustees, serving from May 2012 into his current term. A deeply devoted family man, Dominic was married to Lorraine Kayton Kulik '82 and was the loving father of Dante '15 and Nakai.
