Adored husband of Carol Hillman, brother and brother-in-law to Connie and Leo Miller, uncle to Wayne, Michael, Regina and Hayley Miller, and Molly Mehlsack, great-uncle to Arianna Grace, Mason Oliver and Jaden Alexander, cousin to Barbara Mehlsack. Howard had a forceful thirst for life and knowledge. He traveled the globe, enjoyed the arts of all kinds as well as good food (especially dessert) and drink. He was a man of many qualities - stubborn, feisty, and a consummate punster, balletomane and opera buff. But, most importantly, he loved his wife Carol and his family and friends more than anything else. Howard, we all thank you for the years we got to love each other. We will miss you in ways for which there are no words. Carol, Connie and Leo, Michael and Hayley, Wayne and Regina, Nancy and Ken, Molly and Barbara. Memorial service to be held at a later date. Donations in Howard's memory may be made to the Boston Ballet, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, or the Greater Boston Food Bank. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-29T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  HILLMAN, HOWARD DAVID"}, "print_page": "10", "snippet": "HILLMAN--Howard David, 81, on March 27 after a heroic battle, surrounded by his loved ones.
