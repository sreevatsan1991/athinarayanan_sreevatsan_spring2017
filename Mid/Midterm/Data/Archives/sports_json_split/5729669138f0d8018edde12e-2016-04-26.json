My handsome, charming husband passed away on April 16. We were married over 65 years. Not only was he supportive of my quirky forays into the world of fashion, decor, freelance writing, he was a super dad. He gave his first baby her first bath, and gave her baby his first bath. He would do anything for his children - such as taking a love-sick teen to JFK in the middle of the night so she could say goodbye to her foreign exchange student. He then took her home and got up at 6am to go to work. Fred Kessner volunteered and served in World War II in the battle of Okinawa as a radar technician in the Navy. He went back to college at CCNY under the GI bill and received a Bachelor's degree and graduated as an Electrical Engineer. Eventually, he became the Director of the Codes Bureau of the New York State Division of Housing and Urban Renewal until his retirement in 1996. He attended the Hofstra PEIR group, enjoyed his colleagues' presentations, and brightened them with his jabs of wit. His own presentations were wide-ranging and thorough. He had a second \"career\" as an actor in community theatre and he enjoyed playing \"the heavies\" especially Goldberg in Harold Pinter's \"Birthday Party\". He was a fabulous Granddad to David, Sam, Sarah Beth, Alyson Sheryl, Leah Rose and Evan Jake. He is survived by me - his wife Ellen Zelda, his son Neil Harry (wife Sandra), and his daughter Deborah Jean Indursky (husband Jerrold). He was predeceased by our daughter Sheryl Maude in 1980, and together we went through the trauma of her murder, becoming active in the victims' rights movement. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be held at a later date. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-26T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  KESSNER, FRED LEON"}, "print_page": "21", "snippet": "KESSNER--Fred Leon. 1921-2016.
