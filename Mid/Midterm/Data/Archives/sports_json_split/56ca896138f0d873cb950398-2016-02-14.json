He was born in 1921 in the Bronx to Sarah and Julius Popofsky, joining his older brother Abe. He attended James Monroe High School, and ran the mile in the old Madison Square Garden. He enlisted in the Air Force during WWII and was the bombardier for the crew of \"Catherine the Great,\" a B-17 Flying Fortress and part of the 96th Squadron in the Second Bomb Group. On his 30th mission his plane was shot down by enemy gunfire. He'd survive that plane crash, slamming nose-first into the Mediterranean Sea. But he would take with him the memory of that night, as he watched his plane sink, without all his brothers accounted for. He subsequently flew 21 additional missions, being honored with the Purple Heart and many additional air medals. Returning from the war, William started a family with his beloved wife Edna, graduated from Brooklyn Law School, and began a 30-year career as an attorney with the Federal Trade Commission. He was a courageous survivor. William was diagnosed with cancer four times, battling his way back to health each time. After 65 years of marriage to Edna, he had to face his final battle when she passed away in November 2010. He is lovingly remembered by his son and daughter, Josh and Leslie, and his grandson Ross. He will forever be in our hearts. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-14T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  POPOFF, WILLIAM"}, "print_page": "24", "snippet": "POPOFF--William, was a beloved husband, father, and grandfather who passed away on February 1, 2016.
