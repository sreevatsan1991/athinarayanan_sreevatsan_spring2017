Born at home in Manhattan on April 17, 1917, died peacefully at NYU Langone Hospital on March 29, 2016, surrounded by her family and devoted caretakers. Beloved granddaughter of the late Mary Ellen and John James, beloved daughter-in-law and best friend of the late Agnes Whalen Lawrence. Loving wife of the late H. Sherwood Lawrence, M.D. Cherished mother of Thea (Richard Traub), Victor (Patricia) and Geoffrey (Ida). Adored grandmother of Alexander and Hillary Browne, Andrew and Susannah Lawrence. Her innate strong will and happy nature enabled her to overcome difficult childhood circumstances. Dorothy met her husband-to-be, Sherwood, when both worked at United China Relief. It truly was love at first sight, for when he first saw her he said to himself \"This is the girl for me!\". On the evening of their first date, he proposed to her. Thus began her life-long love affair of 61 years. She loved books, especially antiquarian, read voraciously and enjoyed her hobby of bookbinding. For many years she worked as an Editorial Assistant with her husband, publishing a medical journal as a two-person operation. Her love of Latin and Greek classics led her to get her degree in Classics from NYU at the age of seventy. She was an expert and original knitter and seamstress. Through her Wetherbee family tree, she was a member of the Manhattan Chapter of the DAR. Dorothea was a joyful, independent woman whose positive outlook on life was an inspiration to all who knew and loved her. She had a magical way with all, most of all with young children. Fiercely devoted to her husband, children and grandchildren she kept her home a bright place of love and peace. Dorothea leaves us all a legacy of practical wisdom and a lifetime of love. Her family notes with gratitude the loving devotion of her caretakers, Shanta Itwaru, Marlene Gonzalez, and Monica Marshall. Her family notes with gratitude the kind care of the staff of NYU Langone, especially those on 17 West during her last days. Contributions in her memory may be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or Every Child Valued. Wake to be held at Redden's Funeral Home, 325 W. 14 St., NYC on Thursday, March 31, 2 to 4 and 7 to 9pm. Mass at The Church of the Epiphany, 373 Second Ave., on Friday, April 1 at 10am.
