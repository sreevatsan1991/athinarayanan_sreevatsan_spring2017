As vital, connected and engaged in her last days as she was in all of her 96 years, Shirley Phyllis Loube led a life filled with adventure, glamor and dedicated to philanthropy. Shirley was born and raised in San Francisco, the daughter of Consuelo Maria Carlos Camacho and Manuel Ricardo Lombardero. Immediately upon graduation from Mission High School, Shirley set out for Hollywood and landed a contract with MGM Studios. Working under the stage name Dana Marshall, she played small roles in several memorable films of the 1940s, including \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" \"The Philadelphia Story,\" \"Kismet\" and \"The Great Flamarion.\" In addition to the movies, Shirley was very proud of her work on the stage at the Pasadena Playhouse and the Mercury Players. She also appeared in roles in early television plays. While in Los Angeles, Shirley first lived with her aunt and uncle in the valley, but the commute (and chaperonage) proved daunting, so she jumped at the offer from her friend Maria Rivas to come live in Beverly Hills with her. Maria's mother was Marlene Dietrich, so the next three years were memorable. It was a glamorous time, with chauffeured rides to a factory, where the girls worked making planes for the war effort. There were long days at M.G.M, but also social events in the evenings, where many of the luminaries of the day gathered around the radio at the Dietrich home to hear news of the war in Europe. However, Hollywood proved no match for Shirley's longtime love interest, Irving Loube, and she rejoined him in the Bay Area in 1946 to embark upon a lifetime of love, hard work, success and fun. In her newlywed years, Shirley worked in the advertising department at the San Francisco Examiner, where she demonstrated a magical knack for salesmanship. She put Irving through law school, of which she remained very proud. Her husband went on to become a prominent attorney and businessman. When she concluded that her Irv was overworking, Shirley threatened to leave unless he developed a relaxing hobby. In response, Irving took up sailboat racing and became, with Shirley's unwavering support and encouragement, an accomplished yachtsman. Irv mounted and won many sailboat racing campaigns around the world. Shirley was the chief cheerleader, entertaining countless crews and rival boat owners over the years. Shirley and Irv supported many civic endeavors, including the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy. The Loubes were instrumental in establishing the Oakland Symphony, the Foundation for Cardiac Research at U.C.S.F., the C.P.M.C. Foundation, and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. They were also enthusiastic supporters of the San Francisco Symphony, among many other arts organizations. Shirley was an effective fundraiser and board member, using her gifts of charm, persuasion, persistence and effervescence to aid many worthy causes. In recent years, Shirley was a champion of the Marin Theater Company and thoroughly enjoyed producing several shows there. Shirley is deeply missed by all who came into contact with her. She was preceded in death by her beloved spouse of 55+ years, Irving Loube, and is survived by her adored children, Garrett Loube (Marcia Rodgers) and Suzanne Darley (Mark Darley), and by her grandchildren James Darley and Miranda Darley. She leaves behind countless friends and admirers of her great good humor, wisdom, indomitable spirit, elegant style and joie de vivre. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-12T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LOUBE, SHIRLEY PHYLLIS"}, "print_page": "28", "snippet": "LOUBE--Shirley Phyllis, Born February 22, 1920, died June 8, 2016.
