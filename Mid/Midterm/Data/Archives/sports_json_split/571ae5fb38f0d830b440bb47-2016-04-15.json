The cause of death was a brain hemorrhage after a fall. He was 90. Dr. Rozycki was born on May 31, 1924 in Lublin, Poland. His youthful plans to attend medical school in Paris, France were altered by the outbreak of WWII. His family fled east and they were interned in a Soviet labor camp in Siberia. Upon release, they sought refuge in warmer climates and spent the rest of the war years in refugee-packed Fergana, Uzbekistan. After the war, Dr. Rozycki attended medical school in Wroclaw, Poland, where he met and later married on July 28, 1956, his beloved wife of 57 years, Danuta Lola Rozycki, a physician and surgeon. The Rozyckis immigrated to Israel in 1957 where they continued their practice of medicine and had two daughters. Ludwik served as a physician in the Israeli Defense Force where Ariel Sharon was his battalion leader. The family relocated to New York in 1966 and Ludwik affiliated with Mount Sinai Hospital, practicing at the Elmhurst, Queens location and later opened a private practice. Their next move was in 1970 to Scarsdale, NY, where the Rozyckis lived for over three decades and where Ludwik developed his love of running, to which he credited his excellent health. Dr. Rozycki practiced medicine for over forty-five years, retiring only after his 73rd birthday. He was beloved by his patients for his keen diagnostic skills, his sense of humor and for being one of the last remaining pediatricians practicing in Queens and Brooklyn still making house calls into the 1990s. He valued the companionship of his friends and loved his wife and his family above all else. He is survived by his daughters, Avital Soldatenko (Greg), Sarit Rozycki (Robert Cromwell) and three grandchildren. He was laid to rest in Israel, beside his beloved Lola. The funeral service was held at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale and the family sat shiva at the house of his daughter, Avital. Memorial contributions may be sent to American Friends of Magen David Adom. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-15T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  ROZYCKI, LUDWIK, M.D."}, "print_page": "25", "snippet": "ROZYCKI--Ludwik, M.D.,a Pediatrician with special interest in Pediatric Hematology and Infectious Disease, Holocaust survivor, and avid reader, died on April 21, 2015, at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, CA.
