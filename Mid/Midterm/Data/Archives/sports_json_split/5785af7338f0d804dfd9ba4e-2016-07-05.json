The Zamir Choral Foundation joins the world in mourning the passing of Elie Wiesel, our conscience, transmitter of memory, and a giant among men whose voice and legacy will remain an inspiration for generations to come. A consummate teacher and scholar, and a master of Hasidic song, our Honorary Chairman for a quarter of a century combined his love of music with his profound understanding of text, bringing both to the Heavenly spheres. We are honored to share and continue to be motivated by his deep commitment to moral courage, respect for all humanity, love of Israel and Jerusalem, and the eternity of the Jewish People. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Marion, son Elisha (Lynn), grandchildren and the entire family. May his memory, as was his life, be a blessing to us all.
