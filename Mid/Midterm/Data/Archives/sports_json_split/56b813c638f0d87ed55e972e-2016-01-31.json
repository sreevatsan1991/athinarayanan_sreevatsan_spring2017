Beloved husband of Ursula for 37 years, proud and loving father of Joyce Sjoberg (Kari), William Todd Fairbairn IV (Kelley), and Mary Morgan (George). Adoring grandfather of Ceara, Melanie, Matthew, Latham, Alexander, Beatrice, and Anabelle. Son of the late William Todd Fairbairn Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Latham. Brother of the late Latham Todd, Anne Fairbairn, and Patti Gibney. Uncle to wonderful nieces and nephews. Friend and colleague to many. He lived life fully with passion, energy, and style. As a boy chorister at the Choir School of St. John the Divine, he sang a solo at the funeral of Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, a U.S. Marine, an IBM executive for 24 years, a serial entrepreneur, a long term relationship with Bach Choir of Bethlehem as singer, board member and supporter, long term member of the Amateur Comedy Club in NYC as his father and step- grandfather had been, and an active community board member in Scarsdale, NYC, Bethlehem and Sarasota. He loved language and words of every form-crosswords, all kinds of word puzzles, limericks, gifting books, reading books with grandchildren and more. So it was no surprise that after returning to NYC in 1996, he enrolled full time in Bill Esper's two year Acting Program and upon graduation, with his deep resonant voice, played numerous stage parts including leading roles in The Late Henry Moss, Cockfighters, Buried Child, Merchant of Venice, The Play About Henry, Long Day's Journey into Night as well as playing Lear in three productions of King Lear. Bill was known for his wonderful, witty sense of humor, his kind heart, his charm and elegance and his broad range of interests. He loved water of all kinds-the ocean, the bay, rivers and lakes. There will be a memorial gathering in Sarasota, Florida on Saturday, April 16 and a service at St. Bart's Episcopal Church, 325 Park Ave. at 50th St., NYC on Friday, April 29 at 11am (visitation and reception before and after). In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions in his memory may be made to either the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (www.themmrf.org/donate) or Comfort Zone Camp (www.comfortzone camp.org). Bill had a big aura and lifted us up with it. We will all miss him deeply. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-31T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  FAIRBAIRN, WILLIAM TODD III"}, "print_page": "25", "snippet": "FAIRBAIRN--William Todd III, died on January 10, 2016 in Sarasota, Florida at the age of 80.
