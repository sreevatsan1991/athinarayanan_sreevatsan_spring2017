Pioneering psychiatrist, and long time Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the Columbia College of Physicians & Surgeons, died at home in East Hampton on December 28th. Dr. Ryan played a key role in introducing the use of video to psychiatric education, helping to shape the curriculum for several generations of New York State medical residents. Over his nearly 60 year career, Ryan also maintained an active private practice, first in New York, and then too in East Hampton. Born in 1930 in Albion, NY, Ryan didn't fit the typical mold of psychotherapist. He rode high school football stardom to Yale, where he started as quarterback in his senior year, and also punter and kick-off receiver. Invited to training camp with the Cleveland Browns, Ryan opted instead for Harvard Medical School, and a life beyond football.
