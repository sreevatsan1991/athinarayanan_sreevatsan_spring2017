Citizens' Committee for Children of New York (CCC) mourns the passing of Hamilton F. Kean. We send our condolences to his family, friends, colleagues and those who share our profound respect for Ham's tireless commitment to community service and his impact on the lives of tens of thousands of New York's children and families. His unwavering goal of creating better, more responsive and comprehensive solutions to complicated problems that children frequently face distinguished him from many advocates. He was a particularly staunch advocate for children and adults with mental illness and understood the intricate balance between state hospitals and community care and always advocated for a full continuum of services for seriously mentally ill children. Ham's position never varied: using public resources more wisely, avoiding fads, providing help to children and families as early as possible and as close to home as possible. He was a master at the politics of child advocacy and the art of compromise. Ever thoughtful, balanced in his views, focused on the big picture and willing to wait out the smartest solution. Ham's involvement in CCC spanned nearly 50 years. He took our Community Leadership Course in 1968, became a Board Member in 1971 and assumed leadership of the Board just two years later, helping CCC navigate the rocky shoals of hard financial times in the 1970s. He received CCC's Eleanor Roosevelt Award in 2001 and remained active on the Board through 2006, when he was made an Honorary Director. Ham was an inspiration to all of us and will be deeply missed in our community.
