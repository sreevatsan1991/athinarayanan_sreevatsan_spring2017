Died on February 22, 2016, in Chapel Hill, NC, after a valiant struggle with cardiac amyloidosis. He was 74. Beloved husband of Lynn Goodpasture, father of Keelia with whom he shared a beautiful bond, proud brother of Jim, beloved cousin of Howard Muscott, and loving son of Charles and Jean, both deceased, Alan is deeply missed by his extended family and many friends. Born and raised in Manhattan, Alan was a lifelong New Yorker in his heart. Alan and Lynn were married for 31 years. They made a life together in New York, northwestern Connecticut, Los Angeles, and finally Chapel Hill where they were welcomed by wonderful friends, old and new. Alan led a distinguished career as a producer and professor of film. He held two degrees from Columbia University (BA, MFA). Alan started making documentary films in the late 60s supporting the Civil Rights, Anti-War, and Feminist Movements. He was directly involved in the emerging wave of independent film and video as a founding member of Newsreel, co-owner of Odeon Films, and Executive Director of the Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers. Alan was a founding trustee of the Sundance Institute and board member of the American Film Institute, the Independent Feature Project, and the Southern Documentary Fund. Alan loved the art of storytelling. In Los Angeles, he produced narrative television films for The Film Foundry, his own production company, and others including Mirage Enterprises, CBS, and Hallmark Hall of Fame. He held executive positions at Trans Lux Corporation and Hallmark Entertainment. All of this experience coupled with his natural warmth made Alan a valued teacher at California State University Long Beach where he spent five fruitful years as Assistant Professor of Film. Alan's students will remember him as perceptive, demanding, and compassionate; his business associates admired his expertise and integrity; his friends found him a witty raconteur and gentleman, modest and insightful; his family knew and loved him as utterly irreplaceable. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-06T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  JACOBS, ALAN PERRY"}, "print_page": "26", "snippet": "JACOBS--Alan Perry.
