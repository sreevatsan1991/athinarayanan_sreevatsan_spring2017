She was 72. Known for her love of modernism, Wendy was greatly inspired by her mentors Georgia O'Keefe and O'Keefe's sister, Anita Young. Wendy's artistic expression spanned several mediums. Her work included extraordinary sculptures in wood and aluminum as well evocative paintings in acrylic and watercolor. In 2008, she was selected to be a part of The Dorothy and Herbert Vogel Collection: Fifty Works for Fifty States, which resulted in the placement of her work in museums across the country. Wendy was also blessed with a wry sense of humor. She was beloved for her vast and high-powered email list to which she posted everything from political commentary to dirty jokes. Always savoring a good laugh, she embraced her role as a social connector and loyal friend. There were few things Wendy appreciated more than spending time with her numerous and multifarious friends. Wendy was born in California to Manuela Hudson and Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt II, a pioneer in thoroughbred racing, whose father had gone down on the Lusitania. She grew up between Palm Beach and Manhattan. Wendy was featured in one of Lilly Pulitzer's first advertising campaigns and attended the Truman Capote Black and White Ball in 1966. Although she enjoyed the social circuit, Wendy chose to devote her time to her children and her art. In addition to her work as an artist, Wendy was a founding member of STOP: Stop Traffic Offenses Program, having witnessed a red light runner nearly kill a friend's child. A natural born tinkerer, in the 70s Wendy made her friends light dimmers out of margarine containers for Christmas. She spent countless hours working on benefits for institutions like the New York Studio School. Wendy was also a spirited member of both The Century Association and the Junior Fortnightly. After attending Sarah Lawrence College, Wendy was married the late Orin Lehman, New York State's longest-serving commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. The couple had two daughters. They divorced in 1995. Wendy is survived by her three daughters, Brooke Lehman of Millerton, NY, Sage Lehman of Brooklyn, and Susan Lehman of Greenwich, CT; six grandchildren; and her companion, Bill Beermann. Mrs. Lehman's artistic creativity and passion for her family and friends was unparalleled. Her loyalty and brazen sense of humor will be dearly missed. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-12T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LEHMAN, WENDY VANDERBILT"}, "print_page": "25", "snippet": "LEHMAN--Wendy Vanderbilt, a New York artist whose work resides in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, died of heart failure Tuesday at her home in Manhattan.
