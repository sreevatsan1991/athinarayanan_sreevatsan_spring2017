Peter graduated from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth and obtained his PhD in Physics from Imperial College, London in 1964. He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1972, and was a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, London. After five years of research in condensed-matter physics at Brookhaven National Laboratory, he was appointed Senior Editor of Physical Review B, a position he held until 2012. During those 40 years, he held appointments as Deputy Managing Editor and Deputy Editor in Chief of the American Physical Society Journals. In addition to overseeing the personnel and financial issues of the Editorial Offices of the Society, he also played an instrumental role in the phenomenal growth of Physical Review B, a premier journal in all of condensed and materials physics. Perhaps closest to his professional heart was Peter's success at transforming the peer review process for scholarly physics at the Society. Always a visionary, Peter was responsible for leaving behind paper and moving his office into a digital environment. All aspects of work at the editorial office were included in this decades long revolution. His efforts formed a firm foundation for today's continuing work. Peter was dearly loved and will be sadly missed by his wife, two children and five grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Peter's name to the Leukemia Research Foundation. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-24T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  ADAMS, PETER D."}, "print_page": "24", "snippet": "ADAMS--Peter D.,died Saturday, April 16th.
