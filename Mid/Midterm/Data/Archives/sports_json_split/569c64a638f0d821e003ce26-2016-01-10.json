With great sadness the Yeshiva University community mourns the loss of Judge Judith S. Kaye, who was granted an honorary degree from the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in 1993. Judge Kaye was the first woman to become Chief Judge of New York, serving with great distinction for 16 years, longer than any other chief judge in the state's history. The daughter of Jewish immigrants from Poland, Judge Kaye's distinguished legacy demonstrates her belief in equality before the law, and her commitment to break down barriers in the legal field, and in society at large. Judge Kaye is remembered for the exceptional warmth and generosity she displayed to the Cardozo community, especially in her interactions with students.
