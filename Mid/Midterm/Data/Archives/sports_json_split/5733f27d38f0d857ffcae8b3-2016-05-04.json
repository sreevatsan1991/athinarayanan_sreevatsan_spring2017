She was the beloved wife of 59 years of Charles H. Miller. She is survived by their children, Cathy Castaneda (Mario) of Acton, MA, Steven of Summit, NJ and Jennifer (Michael Grady) of Warwick, RI. She is also survived by her brother, John L. Fried (Roberta) of Milwaukee, WI, her beloved niece Sally Reiner (Larry), and her nephews Alan, Edward, Billy, and Michael. Her greatest joys were her children and her eight grandchildren - Kenny, Andrew and Matthew Miller, David, Mark and Peter Castaneda and Emily and Julia Grady. She left them with many wonderful memories and enough love and laughter to cherish for a lifetime. She was adored and admired by one and all, as well as by a host of friends in White Plains, Milwaukee, the Berkshires, and elsewhere. Mary was born in Milwaukee on June 25, 1930 to Dan and Belle Fried. After college, she moved from Milwaukee to New York and worked for A&S and Gimbels. She later earned a B.A. degree from Manhattanville College, and subsequently a Masters Degree in counseling. She was a career counselor in the Career Development Office at SUNY Purchase, for more than 20 years, where she initiated and developed an internship program for undergraduate students. Mary was an active volunteer in a broad range of activities; she was co-chair of the PTA, a docent at the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College, a volunteer with the pastoral care department at White Plains Hospital, and one of the founders of Aging in Place in White Plains. She was an avid tennis and bridge player, travelled extensively with her husband, family and grandchildren, before and after retirement, and was passionate about all forms of culture, including art, music and theatre. Her enjoyment of these arts was greatly enhanced as a result of her thirty-six summers in the Berkshires. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial contributions be made to Make a Wish Foundation of Central New York, or the White Plains Beautification Foundation. A Memorial Celebration of her life will be held in the near future. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-04T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MILLER, MARY FRIED"}, "print_page": "19", "snippet": "MILLER--Mary Fried, on May 2, 2016 surrounded by her family.
