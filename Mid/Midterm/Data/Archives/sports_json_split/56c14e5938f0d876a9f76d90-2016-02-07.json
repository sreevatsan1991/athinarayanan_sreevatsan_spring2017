Randi Thulin Dubin, who was admired by family and friends for her vivacious spirit, compassionate nature and resilience, died peacefully in her sleep at her home in East Hampton, NY at the age of 61. She was born on June 14, 1954, on Staten Island, NY. She received a BA in psychology from the City University of New York and a MA in counseling at Columbia University. She lived in Manhattan with her husband, Michael Dubin, whom she married in 1982. She and her husband raised three daughters, Krista, Erika and Karoline, who each regard her as their best friend. Randi was selflessly devoted to her daughters and had the ability to make others feel part of the family. She was known as a film aficionado, a gifted chef and a close confidante. Randi had a lifelong interest in advocating for animal rights, adopting four rescue animals and volunteering with Camp Rusk, a foundation for retired horses. While struggling with a motor neuropathy, she inspired us with her sharp wit and vibrant sense of humor. Her ashes will be scattered onto Accabonac Harbor off the dock of the Dubins' Hamptons property. In addition to her daughters and her husband, she is survived by her parents, Einar and Louise Thulin of Staten Island, NY, and two brothers, Richard Thulin of Bethlehem, PA, and John-David Thulin of Southampton, NY.
