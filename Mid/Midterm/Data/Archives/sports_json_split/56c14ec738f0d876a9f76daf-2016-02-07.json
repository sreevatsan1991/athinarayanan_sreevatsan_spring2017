He had been suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. Jim was born on May 31, 1929 to James P. Connors, Sr. and Kathryn Ryan Connors in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Jim grew up in Yonkers and in Eastchester, attending Iona Grammar and High schools and earning a degree in Economics from Fordham University in the Bronx in 1950 where he was the school's squash champion his senior year. He earned his JD from St. John's Law School in Queens in 1953. Jim was drafted into the Army's JAG office later in 1953 and stationed in Hokkaido, Japan. Private Connors went 3-0 defending fellow soldiers accused of various charges, earning several letters of commendation for his service and a promotion to the rank of Sargent. After his military service, Jim launched a nearly 60 year career in private law practice, the bulk of which as a Partner with Smith, Ranscht, Pollock, Manos & Connors in White Plains, NY. He most recently was of counsel to the law firm of Bertine, Hufnagel, Headley, Zeltner, Drummond & Dohn in Eastchester. Jim was active in local Republican politics throughout his career, serving as President of the young Republicans of Westchester County. He also served as the Town Justice of Eastchester from 1983-2011 and was legal counsel and Board Member to the Tuckahoe Savings & Loan and its successor companies. Jim is survived by his devoted wife of 57 years, the former Margaret Gallagher of Larchmont and his sons James Patrick, III (Angela- d. 2015) of Mount Vernon, Michael (Kendall) of Piedmont CA, Mark (Kelly) of Bronxville and Paul (Leeanna) of Croton-on-Hudson and nine grandchildren. Jim was reunited in God's graces with his daughter Meg, who passed away from Hodgkins Disease in 1985 at the age of 25. He is also survived by his brother John of Wilton CT, his close cousin Mary Jo McLoughlin of Garden City, LI and numerous nieces and nephews. Jim recently shared with Peggy how thankful he felt for all the blessings he had enjoyed in his life. He loved his family and he loved his community. Jim worked hard to have a positive impact on both-succeeding wonderfully on both fronts. And no Memorial Day Parade in Bronxville was complete without Jim marching in his straw bowler. Calling Hours at the Fred H. McGrath & Son Funeral Home, Bronxville, between the hours of 4-7pm Saturday and Sunday. A Mass of Resurrection will be held at St. Joseph's Church in Bronxville, NY where Jim spent his life actively participating as an altar server, a Parish Council member and, until last month, as a Lector on Monday, February 8 at 9:45am.
