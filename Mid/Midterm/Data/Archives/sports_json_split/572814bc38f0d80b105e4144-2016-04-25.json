Born in Rochester, NY on July 24, 1928, died at home on April 21, 2016. Daughter of Margaret Goldberg Silverstein who died prematurely in 1951 and Joseph E. Silverstein, a leader of the Rochester Jewish Community and Democratic Party, and long- time City Councilman, Vice-Mayor and Comptroller of the City of Rochester. Bea graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1950 and Cornell Law School in 1953 where, along with her lifelong friend Barbara Paltrow, she was one of two women. Upon graduation she practiced law in New York City and edited law books until 1960. After a 13-year maternity leave, she returned as Associate Director and then Director of the Channel 13/NYU Law School Consumer Help Center. She taught at NYU Law School from 1973-2000 as a member of the Lawyering Faculty and as Director of the Consumer Protection Clinic. In addition, she served as Vice President of the New York City Bar Association and at various times chaired the Executive Committee, Public Service Network, Task Force on Women and the Courts, Committee on Continuing Legal Education, Committee on Medicine and Law and Committee on Legal Education and Admission to the Bar. She also served for many years on the Disciplinary Committee of the First Judicial Department and was a member of The Mayor's Committee on the Judiciary under Mayor Koch. A tireless advocate for the underserved, Bea was particularly proud of the 1990 report she was a co-author of, along with one of her heroes, Robert McKay, The Decline of the Rule of Law in Singapore and Malaysia. She also served for many years on the Boards of Directors of The Children's Law Center, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) and Washington Square Legal Services and on the Executive Committee of the Institutional Review Board at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Bea is survived by Lloyd, her husband of 61 years, her children Margaret (Steve) and Fred (Jacqueline), grandchildren Nathan, Zoe, Stanley, Celia, Adam, Timmy and Phoebe, brother David, and sisters-in-law Jane and Alicia. She will be missed by her large extended family, many friends, students and colleagues as well as the countless people whose causes she championed over the past 60 years and continued to fight for until shortly before her passing. She is remembered for her unique blend of empathy and vigilance, a sensitivity to human suffering combined with meticulous attention to detail, and above all, an unwavering belief in justice and the importance of working towards its attainment. Funeral services are planned for Tuesday April 26, at 10:00am at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Ave (91st). Family will be receiving at home Tuesday 6-9pm. In lieu of flowers, contributions to the Children's Law Center (clcny.org) or to a charity of your choice is appreciated. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-25T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  FRANK, BEATRICE SILVERSTEIN"}, "print_page": "07", "snippet": "FRANK--Beatrice Silverstein.
