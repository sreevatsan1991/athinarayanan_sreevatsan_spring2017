There was no kinder a man, no more precise a mind, no more caring a person, no more pleasingly warm a writer, no more attentive a listener, and no more humbler a person. He was an inspirational leader of great warmth, humility and sense of purpose who invested mightily in Citizens Union and guided us to a place where it could reach levels of activity and influence it had not previously known. Under his leadership, Citizens Union started its publication, www.GothamGazette.com. We will miss his gentle guidance, humor and abiding humanity.
