The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the passing of our dear friend and colleague John L.

John joined the Carnegie Hall Board of Trustees in 1987 and served the Hall with devotion for nearly two decades. John was the visionary chairman and CEO of Tishman Realty & Construction Co., Inc., which has played a central role in virtually all of Carnegie Hall's major capital projects, beginning with the historic renovation and restoration of Carnegie Hall, completed in 1986, and continuing with the Hall's expansion into the adjacent Carnegie Hall Tower, completed in 1990; the construction of Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall, completed in 2003; and the renovation of Carnegie Hall's Studio Towers, completed in 2014.
