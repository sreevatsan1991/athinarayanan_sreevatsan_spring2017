July 9, 1942 - April 4, 2015. One year ago, the world grew a little darker with the death of a beloved husband, father, awesomest and irreplaceable grandfather, brother, FU (Favorite Uncle), friend, consigliore, mentor and just a really great guy. Bob was born on July 9, 1942 in Bronxville, NY to Marshall and Vivian Holcombe and passed away on April 4, 2015. He is survived by his \"child bride\" Mimi, sons Robert S. Holcombe, Jr. (Marci Montoya), Samuel D. Holcombe (Robin Holcombe) and daughter Kathryn Ellen Holcombe (Craig Appel), grandchildren Sage, Calder, Hayes, Samson, Macy, Michelle and Kara. He is also survived by his siblings Eleanor Friedman, Susie Cox, Maynard Holcombe and Andy Holcombe and many nieces, nephews and great-nieces. Bob attended The Lawrenceville School, Princeton University and earned his JD and MBA from Columbia University. Bob was an amazing attorney and never met a challenge he couldn't conquer. If he wasn't working at the office or at home, he was working on vacation. Bob always had a twinkle in his eye, whether it was having fun with his beloved grandchildren or in the board room, he was always one step ahead of everyone. Known for his intellect, humor, love of words and his delicious Egg Nog, Bob has been missed by many and will always be missed by all. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-08T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Memorials  HOLCOMBE, ROBERT SWAINE"}, "print_page": "14", "snippet": "HOLCOMBE--Robert Swaine.
