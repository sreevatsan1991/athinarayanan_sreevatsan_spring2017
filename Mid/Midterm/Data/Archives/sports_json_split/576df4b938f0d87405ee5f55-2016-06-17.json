He was 61. The cause was lung cancer. His death was announced by Mountainside Treatment Center, where he had worked for more than 15 years. One of Mountainside's first clients, Mr. Hodge joined the treatment center's staff in 1998. A key, informal position that Mr. Hodge held was as the Ambassador of Mountainside. Tasked with handing out coins to celebrants at the Friday night AA meeting at Mountainside, Mr. Hodge forever transformed the traditional ceremony by injecting his positive energy and showmanship. Thousands of clients and other attendees from across the globe have a special place in their hearts for Mr. Hodge, as he not only gave them their first coin of sobriety but showed all of those in the room on Friday evenings that in sobriety you can have fun, laugh, and love. As a person in recovery, Mr. Hodge would pass on to others lessons he had learned about life beyond addiction, helping others to understand that being flawed was not only acceptable in life but is part of being human, a message that resonated with those in early recovery. Mr. Hodge, a former Non-Commissioned Officer with the United States Marine Corps, was always willing to share his story of addiction, so that others would feel comfortable sharing theirs. \"Addiction took things I didn't know I had. Recovery gave me things I didn't know I wanted,\" Mr. Hodge would often say. Mr. Hodge is survived by his soulmate Eliza Raphael-Hodge and his four children - Jerrina Lashely, Tanika Hodge, Jerrick Hodge, Jr, all of Baltimore, MD, and Victor Hodge. Jerrick is also survived by his sister Patricia Carter, his brother Reggie Hodge and several grandchildren. He was predeceased by his two brothers, Ronald Carter and Carl Hodge.
