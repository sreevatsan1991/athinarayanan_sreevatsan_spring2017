Pioneer in Design Journalism and Marketing Linda Rimanich Foa passed away peacefully at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on June 17, 2016 after a long battle with cancer. She is survived by her husband, Conrad, their sons, Justin and Barrett, and grandchildren, Max and Luke. Her abiding interest in others, her incomparable style, and her take no prisoners demeanor, meant that everyone knew that she was \"in the room\". Her always-positive impact on her family and friends will be sorely missed. The stars were already aligning because Linda and Conrad were both born in Wickersham Hospital (across the street from Bloomingdale's); Linda was born there 51 weeks after her future husband. Her family resided in Jamaica Estates, New York City, where she graduated from The Mary Louis Academy. Linda majored in Fashion and Fine Arts at Parsons/NYU. Linda's sense of style, superb writing ability, and natural beauty were a unique combination that was unleashed on the world of design journalism. Linda began her professional career at Fairchild's Home Furnishings Daily and HFN where she was an editor, and penned the still-remembered FYI column. While mothering, she wrote several lead cover articles for New York Magazine, articles for The New York Times Style Section, and co-authored Kids' Stuff, the definitive furnishings guide to children's furniture and home environments [Pantheon/Random House]. In the 1990s, Linda headed and brought Designer's Saturday to prominence; producing a world-renowned annual contract furniture show in New York City that featured over 100 participating showrooms. The food and ambiance offered in the showrooms were even reviewed by Mimi Sheraton in The New York Times. For the past 11+ years, Linda was the Marketing Director of the Architects & Designers building at 150 East 58th Street. She is credited with burnishing the building's ability to attract high-end kitchen, bathroom and furniture showrooms. She contributed to a soaring occupancy rate and was instrumental in partnering with The New York Times to host the building-wide Taste of T foodie event for over a decade. Walking through the building with her, it was obvious that she was loved by tenants and co-workers alike. Linda, along with her spouse, were prominent members of the Lexington Democratic Club. She rose to the party post of District Leader and was a fierce proponent of the Club's role in forwarding and bettering the Democratic agenda. It was with great pleasure that she witnessed the presumptive nomination by the Democratic Party of the first female presidential nominee. The success of her children, Justin [fifth generation owner and CEO of 155 year-old international insurance brokerage firm, Foa & Son] and Barrett (respected, multi-talented lead actor, singer, dancer in two Tony Award-winning Broadway shows, with an eight year series-regular role on CBS's \"NCIS: Los Angeles\") speaks volumes about her exceptional mothering. Linda and her husband, Conrad, did everything together and were rarely apart during their 50 year relationship. A memorial service for Linda will we held at the Unitarian Church of All Souls at 1157 Lexington Avenue (80th Street) on June 28, 2016 at 11:00am. There will be a reception for Linda's friends after the service. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-21T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  FOA, LINDA"}, "print_page": "23", "snippet": "FOA--Linda.
