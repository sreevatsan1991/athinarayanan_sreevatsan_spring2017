A longtime resident of the Bronx, Audrey's wit and wonderful conversation and beautiful British accent will be missed by her friends and family. Audrey was married to Eric K. Frey for 40 years. When he died in 1999, her life continued, but her heart was broken. Born in British India, Audrey was a graduate of St. Theresa's in Calcutta, with honors, Senior Cambridge. She also attended the Calcutta Government School of Art. After WWII, Audrey moved from India to New York City, where she studied with the Art Students League. Audrey was a lifelong artist; her hand-drawn cards depicting flowers and animals delighted their recipients, and her cards and books made from dried plants and flowers are truly remarkable and treasured. She always made sure to depict her signature lady bug on her drawings, cards and letters. While working for McGraw Hill Publications Company, Audrey quickly rose to a management level. Hired in 1950, she traveled the world for her job and relished every adventure. Audrey spoke several languages and was one of the first women to hold advanced management positions. She was a trailblazer for those who followed. She became production manager of Coal Age in 1955, then was appointed as US Business Manager of International Management in 1966. In 1976, Audrey was named Director of US Publication Services for International Management. She became the Manager of Marketing Communications at McGraw Hill in 1985, shortly before her retirement. As an eager and capable volunteer, Audrey worked extensively with The New York Botanical Gardens and with Wave Hill, a public garden and nature center in the Bronx. She loved the natural beauty of flowers and plants and had so many plants in her apartment, she had a reputation as an amateur botanist with her very own at-home greenhouse. Audrey is survived by her loving brother, Douglas Spencer and his wife, Madeleine, of Kelso, Scotland, and her niece, Angela Banks of Edinburgh, Scotland. She also is survived by dear friends on several continents, and especially in the Bronx. A tree will be named in Audrey's honor at Wave Hill in the Bronx which will stand close by one already named for her husband, Eric. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-03T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  FREY, AUDREY"}, "print_page": "21", "snippet": "FREY--Audrey, age 89, died January 27, 2016 after a brief illness.
