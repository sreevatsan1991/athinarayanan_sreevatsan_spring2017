Our father Herbert C. Bernard passed away at home on January 16, 2016. He was 103 years old. He loved New York City. As the owner of a manufacturing business, he had clients throughout the City and watched neighborhoods change. He remembered horse drawn carriages filled the street and veterans of the Civil War parading in their uniforms on Memorial Day. His father survived the 1918 influenza and his uncle was gassed in World War I. Dad received an excellent public school education and graduated with highest honors from his high school while working for the Brooklyn Eagle covering sports. He entered Columbia in 1928 but to his great regret, had to leave to contribute to the support of his family. He made up for this perceived shortcoming by visiting libraries and museums. He became a connoisseur of drawings and paintings with a small collection. His deep commitment to the City was expressed in community service. Our father was the longest serving trustee of Congregation Emanu-El; he chaired many of its committees and he and our mother endowed its museum of Judaica. They were both actively involved in a number of charitable organizations. For Dad it included Montefiore Medical Center and UJA-Federation. He also was particularly proud of his service to his industry. For many years he was a board member of the Paperboard Packaging Council and served a term as its non-executive President. In addition to us he is survived by grandchildren, Geoffrey Dann, Deborah Fields, Adam Bernard and Claire Bernard, and great-grandchildren, Rebecca Dann, Emily Dann, and Lion Bernard De Rham. There will be a private family funeral service. Contributions in his honor may be made to the Herbert and Eileen Bernard Museum Judaica Fund at Congregation Emanu-El.
