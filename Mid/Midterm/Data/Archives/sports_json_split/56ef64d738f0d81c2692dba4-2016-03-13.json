The wife of the late Dr. Karl Sass, she was born on August 12, 1917 in Kolbushova, Poland to Betzalel Orgel and Jencia Zeisel Orgel as the fifth of nine children. A holocaust survivor, Sabina endured internment at Tarnopol and the loss of her parents, two sisters, and a brother. Settling post-war in Bytom, Poland, she immigrated first to Israel in 1957, where she and her family lived in Tel Aviv, finally settling in Queens, NY in 1961. She was an integral part of the community and was passionate about her family and helping those in need. Following the death of her husband of cancer in 1972, Sabina devoted herself to others through her work at NYU Medical Center as a receptionist, her dedication to Hadassah, and as a loving mother and grandmother. She is survived by her daughter - Dr. Helen S. Colen, a plastic surgeon based in New York City (Dr. Stephen Colen), two grandchildren - Dr. Kari Colen (Todd Harrison) and Michael Colen, and three great-grandchildren.
