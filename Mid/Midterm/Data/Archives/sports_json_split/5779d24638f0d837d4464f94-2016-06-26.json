September 16, 1919 - June 8, 2016. Asian art historian, founding director of the Asia Society Texas Center, long-time resident in Thailand, wife and mother, Patricia Morris Young's life revolved around her passion for art history, her deep commitment to passing her knowledge on to others, and her unalloyed delight in the wonders of other cultures. From an early age she enjoyed visual expressions of beauty particularly painting and sculpture. Refining this sensibility became a lifelong pursuit. She began with a foundation in European art history which led to her vocation as a lecturer and writer on Southeast Asian art. Born in Washington, DC, she was educated at the Potomac School, Miss Hall's School in Massachusetts, and graduated from Vassar College in 1941 with a degree in History. In 1943 she married Kenneth T. Young, Jr. She raised four children in Washington and New York before moving the family to Bangkok, Thailand, where her husband served as American Ambassador from 1961 to 1963. Her encounter with Asia changed her life. She traveled extensively in Southeast Asia, began her study of Southeast Asian art, and worked to promote contemporary Thai artists. Returning to the United States she combined her roles as wife and mother with graduate studies in Asian art. In 1976 she went to work for the Asia Society, running the Society's Asian tour programs. In 1979 she moved to Houston to become the founding director of the Asia Society Texas Center. She retired in 1986, returning to Bangkok where she spent seventeen years deepening her knowledge of Asian art and culture, traveling widely from Japan to India. Thai art and culture were her special areas of interest and expertise. For many years she pursued a fascination with Thai Buddhist lacquer murals, writing several articles on her findings. A member of the Association of Asian Studies and the Siam Society since the early 1960s, she worked tirelessly to promote an understanding of Asian cultures. Her gifts were her ability to listen, to establish friendships, and to connect like-minded individuals who shared her passion. She was particularly interested in bringing Thai and Western art historians together. She loved learning and encouraged others to do so through teaching and lecturing in Asia and the U.S. She wanted to help others see and appreciate the beauty she saw in Asian painting, sculpture, music, dance, crafts, and architecture. Her graciousness and kindness won her friends wherever she traveled. She is survived by her four children, six grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
