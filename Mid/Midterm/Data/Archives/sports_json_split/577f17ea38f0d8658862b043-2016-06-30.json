Our beloved mom passed away on June 26, 2016, after a brief illness. She was 90 years old. She faced the end bravely and stoically, smiling and saying, \"Que sera, sera.\" She never displayed self-pity, always saying, \"I've lived a wonderful life.\" Mom was born in Union City, New Jersey, on October 30, 1925. Her family moved to Brooklyn when she was a little girl, and there she stayed until she and our Dad, Edwin, made the remarkable move to Phoenix in 1956. That's where she raised her four children, made a loving home for her family, earned her Bachelor's and Master's degrees at Arizona State University, and endured the sorrow of losing her youngest child, Michael John, and in 2003, the death of her soulmate, Edwin. Shirley is survived by her three children, Laurie Benenson (Bill), William Halpern (Veronique), and Glen, and granddaughters Amanda Benenson, Victoria Halpern and Rachel Halpern. Mom was smart, upbeat, funny, argumentative, and stylish. She looked younger than her years, and never lost her joie de vivre. People could never believe her true age. And we can't believe she's gone. Rest in peace, dearest Shirley. We love you.
