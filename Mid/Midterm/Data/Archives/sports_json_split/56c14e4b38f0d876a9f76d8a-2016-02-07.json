Arlene M. Kieta passed away after a courageous battle with COPD on January 25, 2016 in New York City. Born on July 30, 1933 in Chicago, IL to Bruno Charles and Marie Ester Fedro Kieta. Among her many accomplishments: former beauty queen, model, convention narrator, Broadway, film, and television actress including game show co-host, radio disk jockey, and, as a successful Entrepreneur, she established her own public relations firm specializing in fashion, food, and travel sectors. Arlene was a stunningly beautiful woman matched only by her inner beauty. Arlene had a continuous involvement in philanthropic endeavors partially including: Polish Assistance League; Light House for the Blind; Metropolitan Opera; Guggenheim Museum of Modern Art; NYC Public Library; Notre Dame High School (Arlene Kieta Communications Scholarship); Father Wasson's \"Friends of the Orphans\" (board member and supporting a Godchild in ten different countries); and Knights of Malta, \"Lady of Justice.\" Arlene was preceded in death by her loving parents and dear brother Raymond. She is survived by her close and loving brother Dennis L. (Cindy), his children, Kristine M., Derek R. (Emily), Kimberly A. Cermak (Jeff), Cody K., and stepson Ryan Rasmussen, along with five great-nieces and nephews; numerous relatives, godchildren, and lifelong friends. A Memorial Mass will be held at Our Saviour Catholic Church (38th and Park) on Friday, February 12th at 10:00am, with private interment later in Chicago. Please do not send flowers, as Our Saviour Church will not display flowers during Lent. In honor of Arlene's giving spirit, the family requests any memorial contributions be made to a charity of your choice. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-07T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  KIETA, ARLENE MARIE"}, "print_page": "20", "snippet": "KIETA--Arlene Marie, 1993- 2016.
