She passed away peacefully with her loving husband, William R. Rhodes and her loving daughter Jessica Chestman, at her side. A great portion of Louise's life was devoted to the visual arts which she studied, worked with artists, museums and art collectors, and eventually established and headed Louise Tilzer Rhodes Art Advisory (LTRAA). Louise, who had trained at Mass Mutual and held a life insurance brokerage license, was also involved in financial management and served as the President of Iraglo LLC. Louise and Bill Rhodes had known each other for some years and were married in March 2013. Theirs was an incredibly close and warm relationship, and she was constantly by his side. She and Bill lived in Manhattan and she was a New Yorker through and through. One of her early professional projects was working on an award winning documentary, Richard Hambleton's Nightlife, about the artist who gained great initial attention for his artworks on the streets and the sides of buildings in New York. She attended the Curtis High School on Staten Island, New York City, and went on to Syracuse University where she received a BFA degree summa cum laude in art design and painting and then studied for the masters in art history program at Hunter College. She was to work both with many artists and with art collectors over the years: from working early in her career with photographer Bert Stern as curator of his museum exhibitions, and in the production of his archival platinum prints, especially of \"The Last Sitting,\" a collection of photographs of Marilyn Monroe; to an interview in 2011 at the World Economic Forum in Davos with sculptor and public installation artist Olafur Eliasson. Louise is survived by her husband Bill, her daughter Jessica, her son-in-law Scott Chestman, her three grandchildren, Sam, Jack and Charlie, sister Leslie Krasny and Aunt Joy Herman.
