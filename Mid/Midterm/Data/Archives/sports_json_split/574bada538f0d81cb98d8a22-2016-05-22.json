The Rockefeller University mourns the passing of our cherished friend John Codey, who served for nearly two decades as an advisor and executive vice president of Helmsley Enterprises, Inc. and, more recently, as a trustee of the Helmsley Charitable Trust. A guiding light in New York's philanthropic community, John will be remembered for his wise leadership and his dedication to many causes, including medical research and conservation. At Rockefeller, he was instrumental in advancing basic and clinical research through generous grants from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust to establish and help support the Center for Basic and Translational Research on Disorders of the Digestive System. Under the direction of Barry Coller, M.D., the center brings together physicians and scientists for intensive interdisciplinary collaboration intended to result in new treatments for a broad range of health conditions.
