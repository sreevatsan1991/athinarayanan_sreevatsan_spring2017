Flight attendant turned book indexer, lover of dachshunds, raspberries, jazz, theater and all things New York, Sylvia Stark Farrington died June 30 while hospitalized near her summer home in Center Harbor, New Hampshire. Born in Santa Clara, Cuba, November 16, 1926, to an American father and Cuban mother, she joined Pan American in its glory days to see the world. While airborne she met the love of her life-- whom she noticed because he was reading D.H. Lawrence--and with whom she traveled widely. Africa was a favorite destination. She is survived by her pilot husband, Robert \"Bob\" Farrington, extended family in Texas and Florida, and a wide circle of friends who will miss her keen intelligence, dry wit and loving embrace. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-07-10T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  FARRINGTON, SYLVIA STARK"}, "print_page": "20", "snippet": "FARRINGTON--Sylvia Stark.
