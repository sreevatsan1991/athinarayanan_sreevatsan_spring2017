Passed away on March 13, 2016 at her Santa Fe, NM home, surrounded by family and friends. Joy was born in Trenton, NJ on June 24, 1927 and grew up in Great Neck, Long Island. She lived in Great Neck and Jackson Heights, Queens before settling in Santa Fe, NM 30 years ago. Joy was a staunch advocate for her father, the artist Max Weber and spent her life working to promote and preserve his legacy. His work is represented by the Gerald Peters Gallery in both New York City and Santa Fe.

Joy was passionate about classical music and opera in particular as well as nature, politics and her beloved Corgis.
