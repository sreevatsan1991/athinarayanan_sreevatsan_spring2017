Darling Dalia, You were the most beautiful woman who ever crossed the threshold of my vision. Not only were you gorgeous, you were incredibly intelligent, sensitive, kind and caring.

Your six grandchildren Sam, Michael, Ben, Nicholas, Olivia, and Jamie adored their Grandma Didi and will hold you forever in their hearts.
