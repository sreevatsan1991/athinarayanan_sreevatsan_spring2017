Son of the late Edward Schwartz and Davida Schatz Edelson, Lew grew up in Meriden and West Hartford, Connecticut. He graduated from the Kingswood School (1968), Yale College (1972), and Cornell Law School. Lew began his legal career as an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan, later becoming a litigator at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. After returning to Connecticut, Lew became a partner specializing in employment law and litigation at Schatz & Schatz, Ribicoff & Kotkin, a firm started by his maternal grandfather that later merged with Shipman & Goodwin. In 2001, Lew joined Gartner, serving as Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary, and Chief Compliance Officer, where he just celebrated his 15th year. Despite his myriad academic and professional accomplishments, Lew enjoyed no job more than his years as a coach and president of the North Stamford Little League. Lew's enthusiasm and love for life was boundless. He was an avid cyclist, wine enthusiast, and lifelong Yankee fan and 30-year season ticket holder. Lew's travels brought him to dozens of countries, and his network of friends and colleagues stretches around the world. Lew's most extraordinary role was as husband to Marjorie and father to sons Ethan and Alex, all of whom survive him and cherish his memory. The burial was private. For those wishing to honor him, please consider a donation to Stamford Hospital, sharecancersupport.org, or a charity of your choice. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-31T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  SCHWARTZ, LEWIS G."}, "print_page": "25", "snippet": "SCHWARTZ--Lewis G.,65, died Friday, January 29th at Stamford Hospital.
