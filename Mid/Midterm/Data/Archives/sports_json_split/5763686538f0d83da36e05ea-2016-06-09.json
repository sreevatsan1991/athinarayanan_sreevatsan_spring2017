He lived in New York City for many years and then moved permanently to Litchfield in 2003. His parents were Olga Willoughby Ellis and Henry Clyde Ellis; his older sister, Patricia, predeceased him. For 48 years he was most happily married to Jane Bacon Ellis, who died in 2011. He is survived by loving daughters Clare Ellis of New York City and Kate Ellis Hobsbawm of London, England; son-in-law Andy Hobsbawm; grandchildren Milo and Eve Hobsbawm; and his wonderful partner, Karen Silk. For two years, Bill attended LSU, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned a BA in architecture in 1957. He received an MA in city and regional planning from Rutgers University in 1969. From 1969 to 1982, he was a fellow at the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in New York City. He was a professor of architecture at the City University of New York, a visiting professor at The Cooper Union, and a visiting lecturer at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the Smithsonian Institution. Throughout his professional academic life, he remained an architect in private practice. Bill will be remembered by his family, his colleagues, and his many friends for his intelligence, wit, charm, insightfulness, generosity, and sweet nature. A celebration of his remarkable life will be held at the Litchfield Country Club on Saturday, June 11, 2016, at 2:00pm.
