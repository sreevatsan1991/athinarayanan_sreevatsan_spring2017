On May 13, 2016, peacefully at home. Beloved brother, uncle, great-uncle, cousin, nephew, friend, partner, adviser, and counselor. Born in Manhattan, he was raised in Englewood, New Jersey, graduated with a BA in History at the University of Pennsylvania and earned an MA in Transformational Counseling from Southwestern College. While a committed New Yorker, he also spent considerable time in Italy, Venezuela, Brazil and Santa Fe and travelled extensively. His varied experiences included dancing in the movie \"Hair\" for Twyla Tharp, and performing with Robert Wilson. He also co-produced the first productions of Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues, One Man Band and Word of Mouth. His true calling was as an AIDS and LGBT activist and as a psychotherapist. For many years he facilitated groups and lead workshops, nationally and locally, including at Friends In Deed, where he was Co-Chair of the Board for seven years. He was a regular contributor to The Huffington Post and other popular sites, and his writings were collected into his well- received book, the \"New 60: Outliving Yourself and Reinventing a Future.\" To his family and friends, Bobby's greatest gift was his capacity to be forever caring, giving, vibrant and loving, and to live and face challenges courageously and with grace. His special circle of friends provided him with extraordinary caring and love during his last battle with pancreatic cancer. He will be sorely missed by his two brothers and wives, Allen and Beth and Jack and Roberta, his loving nieces, nephews, grand-nieces and grand-nephews, dear cousins, aunts, brothers and sisters- in-law, and many friends.
