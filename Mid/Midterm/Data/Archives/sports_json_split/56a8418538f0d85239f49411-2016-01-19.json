The faculty and staff of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and the Maltz Research Laboratories at the Johns Hopkins Medical Campus mourn the loss of their inspirational and beloved Founder and Director, Constance Lieber. For more than 30 years, she led an international movement to bring research about behavioral brain disorders to the forefront of biomedical science. Connie Lieber's vision, her determination, and her historic generosity launched thousands of scientific careers. In 2010, she established the Lieber Institute for Brain Development because she was convinced that a new strategy was needed to accelerate progress and to find cures for developmental brain disorders. As she said: \"This is our dream, to find out what causes these disorders, and we felt it had to be a concerted effort, to study the brain and how it develops, and this is what the Institute is all about.\" The world of behavioral and developmental neuroscience has lost one of its strongest advocates and supporters. Connie is always in our hearts and minds. In honor of her passion and commitment, we will work tirelessly to achieve the mission she empowered us to pursue. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-19T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LIEBER, CONSTANCE"}, "print_page": "25", "snippet": "LIEBER--Constance.
