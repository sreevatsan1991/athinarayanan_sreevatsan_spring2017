Of Vero Beach, FL and Darien, CT, died after a short illness in his Florida home on January 9, 2016 at age 90. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Joanne Kelly Hagopian; his daughter Susan Goddard and sons Thomas and Matthew; nine grandchildren; his sister Helen Geovjian; and more than 40 members of his extended family. Lou thought himself to be one of the luckiest men in the world, with a wife and family who loved him and whom he loved dearly, parents he respected and adored and a career he both enjoyed and succeeded in beyond his wildest hopes. As the son of parents who fled to the United States after their families were killed in the Armenian Genocide, he felt that he truly lived the American Dream and loved this country for it. Lou served in the US Navy during World War II and graduated from Michigan State University after the War. His career started in the auto business, but his skills in marketing and communications soon led him to a successful career in advertising with the oldest agency in the US, NW Ayer. He led NW Ayer for over 25 years, including the last ten as Chairman and CEO. During his tenure, Ayer was selected Agency of the Year and developed numerous iconic advertising campaigns with taglines such as \"A Diamond is Forever\" and \"Be All That You Can Be.\" He also was Chairman of the Advertising Association of America and a founding member of the innovative Partnership for Drug-Free America. Lou was a man of style with an enormous heart, tremendous charm and a wicked wit. He loved to serenade his wife, Joanne, with \"Misty\" or \"My Funny Valentine\" whenever given the slightest excuse (and often without). An avid and excellent golfer for over 70 years, he started as a caddy at the Pine Lake Country Club outside of Detroit and ended as a member of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews (where he won the Seniors Tournament at the age of 86). Services will be held at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in Darien, CT at 10:30am on Saturday, January 16. A memorial service will also be scheduled for friends and relatives in Vero Beach in the next several weeks. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that a memorial donation be made to Indian River Habitat for Humanity, www.irchabitat.org. Services are under the direction of Strunk Funeral Home and Crematory, Vero Beach.
