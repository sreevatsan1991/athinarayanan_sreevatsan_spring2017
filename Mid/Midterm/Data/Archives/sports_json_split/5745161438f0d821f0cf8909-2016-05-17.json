He was born in Akron, Ohio, and graduated from the University of Akron in 1977. He moved to New York that year to study at Columbia Law School, where he became a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar and received a letter of commendation from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, his Constitutional Law professor. He joined the firm Squire, Sanders & Dempsey in Cleveland in 1980 and practiced public finance law before moving to New York in 1984 to begin a career in corporate and securities law. He became a partner of the firm in 1989 and spent the next 27 years representing his clients with distinction at the now Squire Patton Boggs. Alan especially relished his role as legal counsel to the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Musicians Emergency Fund, both of which he served for more than 30 years. He is survived by his wife of 32 years, Val Castronovo; daughter Olivia B. Waxman; sisters Barbara Miller, Arlene Bass (Ron), and Harriet Waxman; five nieces and nephews; and seven grand-nieces and grand-nephews. Alan was an Ohio boy who loved New York City.
