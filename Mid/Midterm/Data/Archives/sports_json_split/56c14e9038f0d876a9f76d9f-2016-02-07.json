Of New Rochelle, NY, 88, died peacefully on February 2, 2016, surrounded by her beloved husband of 67 years, Leroy \"Lee\" and her family. The daughter of the late Charles and Patricia Raizen, \"Sunny\" lit up every room she entered. She loved life and her passions were family, gardening, music, world affairs and travel with Lee. Sunny, an honors graduate of Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, is also survived by her children Steven Fadem and Laurie Baskin, Barbara and Jeff Hayden, Kathy Ivrey and Diane and Jeff Kennedy; her adored brother Roy and his children Jill and Robert Serling and David Raizen and Bettina Daloia and their children. Her greatest legacy is her grandchildren, Rachel and Chloe Fadem; Mark, Daniel and Sarah Hayden; Caitlin and Carly Ivrey and Cody Kennedy, who were all madly in love with their Grandma Sunny and she loved them back with an intense fervor. She taught all of us what it means to be loving and caring and how to overcome any adversity with a smile, tenacity and grit. She will be missed in ways she will never understand.
