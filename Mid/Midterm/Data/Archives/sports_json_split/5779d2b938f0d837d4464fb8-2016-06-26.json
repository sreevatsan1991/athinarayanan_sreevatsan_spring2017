The Trustees, faculty, and staff of the University of Pennsylvania are deeply saddened by the death of our great friend and Emeritus Trustee, Jerome Fisher. A devoted alumnus of the University, Jerome served on Wharton's Board of Overseers, as well as on the Penn Medicine Board of Trustees. Jerome's memory will live on at Penn through the many ways in which he helped to transform the University's physical and academic landscape over more than two and a half decades. He and his wife, Anne, endowed the Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology, a renowned model of interdisciplinary learning; supported the restoration of landmark campus buildings; provided scholarship aid; and established professorships at Penn Medicine. Jerome was extremely proud that five of his grandchildren continued his legacy by attending his alma mater. As we remember Jerome for his great warmth, devotion and service to the university community, we extend heartfelt condolences to Anne, his children, grandchildren, and extended family and friends.
