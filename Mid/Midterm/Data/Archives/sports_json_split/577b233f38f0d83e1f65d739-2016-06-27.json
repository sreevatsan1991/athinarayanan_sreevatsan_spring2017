Okoronkwo, Kanu David Okoronkwo, Ifeoma Okoronkwo and daughter-in-law, Nieves Chevalier Okoronkwo were all present at her bedside as she was ushered from this world to the next. Also, present were her grandson, Jean Pierre Hernandez who represented all of her eight grandchildren, as well as two of her most beloved caregivers, Carol Blair and Synetta Smith. Sylvia Okoronkwo was born in Weldon, North Carolina to Wilbert Johnson and Pauline Stith. After gaining the highest accolades in academics, she went on to study nursing where once again she excelled. While pursuing graduate studies in nursing at Columbia University she met Kanu Okoronkwo, Sr., and in May, 1959 the two were married at St. John's Cathedral in New York City. The young couple returned to Kanu Okoronkwo Sr.'s native land, Nigeria, where Sylvia Okoronkwo pursued volunteerism at the local hospitals and played hostess to various actors and dignitaries, while her husband became the head of telecommunications of southeast Nigeria. Sylvia and Kanu Okoronkwo brought three children into the world, Chinyere, Kanu and Ifeoma. But, at the climax of the Biafran War in 1967, with their lives in danger, Sylvia Okoronkwo fled Nigeria with her three children in tow and one suitcase in hand to her birth land of the United States of America. Still known for her excellence in nursing and having kept her credentials active, Sylvia Okoronkwo was appointed surgical nurse to the newly opened cardiothoracic unit at the New York Hospital. Mrs. O, as she was famously known, ended up working for New York Hospital for almost 40 years in the pediatric urology unit and finally as the medical nursing supervisor of the evening shift. It was her love of nursing, and the love of her grandchildren, that truly sustained her throughout her life. Sylvia Okoronkwo is survived by her children Chinyere Okoronkwo, Kanu David Okoronkwo, Ifeoma Okoronkwo, her daughter-in-law, Nieves Chevalier Okoronkwo, her dear Yeimi Chevalier and her grandchildren, Anastasia Williams Okoronkwo, Aaron Hernandez, Kate Aitkenhead, Jean Pierre Hernandez. Sophie Aitkenhead, Lauren Aitkenhead, Daniel Okoronkwo and Samantha Okoronkwo, whom she called her \"dancing girl\". A Funeral Mass, with Father Emmanuel Oktalauwaekwe presiding, will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Ave., at 11am, Monday, followed by a burial at Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Hawthorne, New York. There will be a lunch to follow at Casa Rina Restaurant in Thornwood, New York. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-27T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  OKORONKWO, SYLVIA PAULINE JOHNSON"}, "print_page": "19", "snippet": "OKORONKWO--Sylvia Pauline Johnson, passed away peacefully on June 22, 2016 surrounded by love; her children Chinyere Y.
