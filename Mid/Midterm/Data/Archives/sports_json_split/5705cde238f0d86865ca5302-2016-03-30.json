Her warmth, class, intellect, humor, and love were evident to all who were blessed to know her. Leslie was an extraordinary human being. Her courage, strength, perseverance, and grace in the face of incredible challenges were an inspiration to everyone around her. Through her amazing humility and sheer will, she refused to allow cancer to limit her joy or to allow others to be fully aware of her struggle. Leslie was born in New York City and attended Bronx Science High School. Initially she attended Boston University but moved back home and graduated from Rutgers University in order to help her ailing mother. After college she traveled around Europe and lived in Geneva, Switzerland for six months, falling in love with the city. Upon returning to New York, Leslie worked for a dress company in the garment district and took part in the Beatnik scene. Shortly thereafter Leslie met the love of her life, Marvin Brittman on a blind date. They got married and had their first child, Rochelle. When Rochelle was just three months old, and Marvin was working for Arthur Andersen, the young family took the opportunity to relocate to Europe for three years. They first moved to a small French village near the Swiss border and then to Brussels, Belgium where a second child, David was born. Leslie had a successful professional career as an administrator for intellectual property law firms, most notably Arnold, White and Durkee in Houston, and Darby & Darby in New York. Subsequently, she volunteered her financial expertise for Adaptive Design Association whose goal was to ensure that children with disabilities receive the customized adaptions they need to reach their full potential. Leslie was also very active in philanthropic activities within the Jewish Community in New York and Austin. Leslie had a deep intellectual curiosity about life and humanity. She loved to discuss ideas and was a passionate patron of the arts. She attended the symphony and opera regularly and was a voracious reader and member of four book clubs. More than anything else Leslie built true and deep relationships. Her generosity and spirit made her loved by all. In every place she lived she collected dear friends and never let them go - in some cases lasting more than sixty-five years! Leslie was also a central figure in her extended family, taking every opportunity to bring everyone together to celebrate life. Leslie is survived by her loving family, husband Marvin, daughter Rochelle, son David, son-in-law Dan, siblings Diane and Richard and grandchildren, Noah, Kira, Ever, and Stella, and a large circle of relatives and life-long friends. Graveside services will be held at 1pm on Wednesday, March 30, 2016 in the Beth Israel 3 section of Capital Parks Cemetery in Pflugerville, TX. The Leslie S. Brittman Literary Fund has been created in Leslie's memory at the Jewish Foundation of Austin and Central Texas, a family of funds at the Austin Community Foundation.
