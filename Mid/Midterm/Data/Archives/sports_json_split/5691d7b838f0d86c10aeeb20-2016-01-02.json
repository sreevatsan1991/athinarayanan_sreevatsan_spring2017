Born in New York City, Charlie was a graduate of Riverdale Country Day School and Amherst College. He spent his early investment career at M.A. Shapiro, New Court Securities, and E.M. Warburg Pincus. For the past 32 years, Charlie and Kristin were business partners of Flood Gamble Associates, an investment management firm. Recently, Flood Gamble joined American Capital Management. Charlie was a dedicated and scrupulously honest businessperson who brought his deep intelligence to his tireless work for his clients. He enjoyed getting to know people of all backgrounds and loved nothing more than the everyday banter he had with friends, clients, neighbors, and everyone he encountered. He had a unique sense of humor and enjoyed gently ribbing people. His weekends were spent gardening and doing chores-Charlie's way of relaxing-in their second home and beloved community of Hudson, New York. Charlie loved the Hudson Valley and, with Kristin, was dedicated to the protection of the Hudson River and its environs. A lifelong Democrat and avid Obama supporter, Charlie enjoyed talking politics and railing against what he felt were the wrongs in society. He also contributed to many social causes. Charlie learned guitar as an adult and his playing and singing were an integral part of his time spent with family. A much-loved spouse, father, and grandfather, Charlie will be greatly missed by his wife of 40 years, Kristin Gamble, his daughters Deborah Flood and Karen Flood, his son-in-law Michael Benedek, and his grandchildren Naomi, Oscar and Violet. A celebration of Charlie will be held at 4:30pm on January 7 at the Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th Street in New York City.
