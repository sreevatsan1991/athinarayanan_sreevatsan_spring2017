On Monday, June 6, 2016 Heaven became a little more fabulous as Paige Ethington Hardy formally became an angel, ending her lifetime apprenticeship. While ovarian cancer may have taken her life, she won the battle, fighting with dignity, humor and grace. Until the very end, she remained the strong, happy, beautiful and courageous Paige that we all loved, unafraid and confident in her faith in God. Paige's personality and smile radiated happiness and compassion. She laughed loudly and often and she gave freely without expecting anything in return. Her beautiful spirit will live on in her five children that she absolutely adored and in the memories of countless people that she touched. A loving and devoted wife, mother, daughter, sister and friend, she is survived by an adoring husband of 17 years, Tripp and their five incredible children Basil (13), Bennett (12), Tate (10), Ivy (9) and Byron (5) of New York City; parents Mary Faye and Donnie Ethington and brother, Tim, of Shelbyville, Kentucky; mother-in-law, Virginia Hardy of Roswell, Georgia; sister-in-law, Heather Perry and husband Dan, niece Leah and nephew Levi of Marietta, Georgia. Paige also leaves behind numerous aunts, uncles and cousins. Raised in Shelbyville, Kentucky she is a graduate of Shelby County High School and the University of Kentucky, where she pledged Delta Delta Delta Sorority. She gave her time generously to organizations in support of her faith, family and friends, including serving on the Women's Committee Board of Directors of the Central Park Conservancy, on the Women's Committee at St. James Episcopal Church, on the Associate's Committee at Doubles, and as an active parent at the Episcopal School, the Browning School and the Convent of the Sacred Heart. A funeral service in celebration of Paige's life and legacy will be held at First Baptist Church in Shelbyville, Kentucky on Tuesday June 14, 2016 at 2:00pm. Public visitation is from 11:11am until 2:00pm. The Reverend Maurice Hollingsworth and the Reverend Bob Vasser will be officiating.

A memorial service will be held in New York on Thursday June 16, 2016 at 11:11am at St. James' Episcopal Church located at 865 Madison Avenue. As her friends know, she felt surrounded by angels at that time every day. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in her honor to either the Central Park Conservancy, 14 East 60th Street, New York, NY 10022, or the Ovarian Cancer Translational Research Fund care of Dr. Carol Aghajanian, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave., NY, NY 10065. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-12T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  HARDY, PAIGE ETHINGTON"}, "print_page": "28", "snippet": "HARDY--Paige Ethington.
