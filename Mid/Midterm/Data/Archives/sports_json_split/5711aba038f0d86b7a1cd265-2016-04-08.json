NewYork-Presbyterian mou- rns the death of our esteemed Life Trustee Ogden Mills \"Dinny\" Phipps. Elected a Governor of The Society of the New York Hospital in 1976, Mr. Phipps was a loyal steward of NYP for forty years. He continued the tradition of board service begun by his father, Ogden Phipps, and carried on by his son, Ogden Phipps II. As the indefatigable Chairman of the NYH Finance Committee, Mr. Phipps steered this institution through financially challenging times. He also was a longstanding and valued member of the Real Estate and Facilities Committee. Mr. Phipps' judgment was sought and relied upon; his directness and wisdom were greatly appreciated. Notwithstanding his many commitments to, and storied achievements in, the worlds of finance, racing and sports, Mr. Phipps devoted considerable time and attention to this hospital. A Trustee for whom his colleagues had great admiration and real affection, Dinny Phipps will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. Phipps' wife Ande, his daughters Kayce, Kelley, Lilly, Daisy and Samantha, and his son, our Trustee Ogden. Frank A.
