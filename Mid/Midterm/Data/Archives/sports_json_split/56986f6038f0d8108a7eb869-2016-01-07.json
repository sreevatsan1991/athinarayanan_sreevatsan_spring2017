The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall celebrate the life of our dear friend and colleague Pierre Boulez, one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century. A legendary composer, conductor, musical philosopher and activist, Pierre Boulez was a visionary and trailblazing global force for modern music. Carnegie Hall was privileged to elect him an Honorary Trustee in 1995, and to appoint him as the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair from 1999 to 2003. Boulez made approximately 75 appearances at Carnegie Hall, conducting close to 60 performances on our stages, and his works have been performed on more than 80 programs. As an arts educator, he was inspirational-challenging audiences to explore a new aesthetic of music through his musical research center IRCAM, and, in the course of the Professional Training Workshops he led through Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, offering profound insights to young musicians. Boulez's work in Paris served as an inspiration in the conception of Zankel Hall, the opening season of which included performances by Boulez with the Ensemble Intercontemporain. Pierre Boulez will be deeply missed by all of us at Carnegie Hall and by the entire artistic community, though his brilliant musical legacy and pioneering spirit will stay with us all. We express heartfelt condolences to his sister, Jeanne Chevalier Boulez, and brother, Roger Boulez, as well as their many children and grandchildren. Sanford I. Weill, President; Mercedes T.
