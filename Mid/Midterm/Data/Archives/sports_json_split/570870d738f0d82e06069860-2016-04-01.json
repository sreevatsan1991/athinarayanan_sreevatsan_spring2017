Born Natalie Florence Rubin 93 years ago today on April 1, 1923, in Manhattan on April Fool's Day, Easter Sunday and Passover. Daughter of Ray and Bernard Rubin, the Tootsie Roll scion. Natalie was the first graduating class of the Leonard School for Girls. With no previous training, but with a steely determination, she pursued her dream to become an actor and gained acceptance to the prestigious School of Drama at Carnegie Tech where she received her BFA. Just as she began a career on stage and on the radio in New York City, she met Jeff Jaffe on a blind date. Six months later they were married and that union lasted until his death in 2014, 68 years. Though she had no formal title, Natalie was Jeff's partner during his tenure as owner and CEO of the Chunky Corporation, and later as President of Schrafft's. The quintessential hostess, but with a razor sharp intellect, she quietly helped steer her husband's business endeavors throughout his multi- faceted career. Throughout her life Natalie was passionate about the theatre and was active on numerous theatrical boards in New York, Boston and later at the Lyric in Florida. She always said she'd never walk out on a stage performance and she never did. For many years she volunteered for the Association for the Blind and transcribed Braille. She is survived by her brother, Edgar Rubin, two daughters Bonnie Berens and Holly Jaffe, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Always the epitome of elegance and restraint, she possessed a rare wisdom that taught us well. We miss her terribly. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-01T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  JAFFE, NATALIE R."}, "print_page": "15", "snippet": "JAFFE--Natalie R.,died peacefully on July 10, 2015 in Palm Beach Gardens, Fl.
