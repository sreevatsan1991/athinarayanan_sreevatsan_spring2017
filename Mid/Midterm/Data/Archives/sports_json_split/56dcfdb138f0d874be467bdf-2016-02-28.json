He was born in The Netherlands on March 13, 1950. He was the Managing Director of The Netherlands Chamber of Commerce in the U.S., was a consummate networker, and hired many Dutch interns which was the start of his history of helping and mentoring young people. At age 26, he lost both legs in a car accident. Kersen was soon walking again with two artificial legs. He dedicated his entire life to not being handicapped. He became an outspoken defender of equality and social justice for the handicapped, underserved, and the underrepresented. Kersen was dedicated to creating educational and cultural opportunities for young people. His passion for music led to his association with the Boys Choir of Harlem often funding their high school and college education. He started a new foundation called The Netherlands American Community Trust. Many have gone on to become successful opera singers, playwrights, and entertainers. He was a member of the Board of Governors for the Roosevelt Institute and The Four Freedoms, a member and judge of the United Nations Franklin D. Roosevelt International Disability Rights Award Advisory Board, board member of A Leg to Stand On, instrumental in setting up the Chicago Boys Choir, and helped start the Choir Academy of Chicago. Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands considered his contributions to Dutch interests in the United States so valuable that she granted him a Knighthood in the Order of Orange-Nassau. Kersen will be remembered for his passion for living and most of all his generosity. He gave to many unconditionally. He believed he could make the world a better place. He will be fondly remembered for the lives he touched and the lasting impact he had on the communities he served. His life is living proof that you can change things in this world. He is survived by Phillip Perkins, his life-long partner of 37 years, and a brother, Martin De Jong. Donation in lieu of flowers to Shake-a-Leg, Miami.
