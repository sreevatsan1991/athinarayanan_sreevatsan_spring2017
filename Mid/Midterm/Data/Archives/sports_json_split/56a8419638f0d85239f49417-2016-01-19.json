Age 70, of Hewlett Bay Park and Manhattan, passed away peacefully at home on January 17, 2016 after a long and brave battle with Multiple Myeloma. Loving husband of Lorraine, beloved father of Gregg and Jill, father-in-Iaw of Lauren and Jake and proud grandpa to Emma, Leah, Miles and Sadie.

Richard was an avid swimmer, winning a gold and silver medal at the Maccabi Games in 1961 and met his wife Lorraine at the Maccabi Games in 1965.
