With deep sadness, we mourn the passing of Alice Ring Garr, 90, in Newtown, PA on March 17, 2016 after a battle with cancer. Alice was the devoted and proud mother of Emily, Jim, Patty and Tom, sons-in-law Milt and Paul and daughters-in-law Lisa and Darlene along with her nine grandchildren, Eric, Marc, Michael, Sam, Jocelyn, Allison, Bradley, Jeremy and Justin. She leaves behind her devoted sister Madeline Kent and her beloved companion Joel Flaks. Alice graduated as one of only two women Physics majors from Cornell University in 1947 and worked as a spectroscopist for several years at Bell Labs in New York. Twenty years later, Alice attended Hofstra University to obtain her Masters' degrees in Teaching and Administration. She was a math teacher at Shelter Rock Jr. High School for 30 years and chairman of its Math department. Alice was a nationally recognized author for the Merrill Math Textbook Series and tutored hundreds of students and young teachers throughout her career. After retirement, Alice continued to teach, working with non- violent prisoners to help them gain their GED. Alice was a life-long adventurer, traveling the globe learning about animal life and diverse cultures. She was a past President of the Pennswood Village Community Association and an active member of her community.
