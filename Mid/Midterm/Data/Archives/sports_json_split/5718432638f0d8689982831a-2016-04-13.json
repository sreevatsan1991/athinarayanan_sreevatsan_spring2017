He was born in Spring Lake, New Jersey in 1922, was raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey until age 13, and was sent to boarding school graduating at age 16. Convinced that his country would be involved in the war then raging in Europe, he attended a college that had an accelerated program and graduated at age 19. As a member of \"The Greatest Generation\" he immediately entered the Navy V7 program and 90 days later was commissioned an Ensign. He was sent to anti-submarine warfare school in Florida and fleet gunnery school in California and then went to the Pacific theater where he participated in the struggle for the control of the Bismarck Sea and the eastern Solomons. His ship was sunk off Leyte Gulf at the outset of the invasion of the Philippines. He continued to serve in the Pacific theater, including in the first landing at Guadalcanal. He was a highly decorated veteran and honorably separated from the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant USNR in 1956. Dick entered Columbia University's School of Law on the GI bill, graduated in 1948 and passed the New Jersey bar exam that same year. Shortly after opening an office in Newark he was offered a clerkship by Justice Nathan L. Jacobs which he accepted and had an exceptional experience learning from a great lawyer and jurist. After his clerkship he opened a law office in Newark, New Jersey and was the senior partner in the firm of Amster and Levin. He ultimately moved the office to Millburn and then went of counsel with a law firm in Roseland. He was appointed to Columbia Law School's Board of Visitors and in 1981 was awarded its medal for conspicuous service to the law school. During his years at the bar he was trustee and chairman of the Clients Security Fund, Chairman of the American Bar Association Committee on Client Security and a member of its prestigious Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. He retired from the practice of law in 1998. In addition to practicing law Dick was a trustee of the Newark Beth Israel Hospital. When the hospital was sold, he became a charter trustee of the Health Care Foundation of New Jersey, which administered the very substantial funds from the sale of the hospital and became a major charitable grantor to needy health related organizations. He was a founder of the Democrats for Good Government which led the fight to reform the democratic organization in Essex County. He was an early proponent of tort reform in New Jersey, which resulted in the enactment of automobile nofault legislation. Dick's service to his community was as co-founder of the Millburn Short Hills First Aid Squad which he served as captain and president. He was also president of the Millburn Short Hills Little League and counsel to the Neighborhood House which was the home of the visiting nurse and other health related facilities. Governor Kean appointed him to the Board of Commissioners of the New York and the New Jersey Maritime Pilot & Docking Commission with the understanding that he would modernize its operations. With the help of subsequent appointees, the Commission became an effective oversight body seeking to ensure safe navigation in the Port of New York and New Jersey and ultimately brought in all docking pilots for licensing and regulation. He was reappointed by successive governors and served for thirty years before retiring. By far the most important event of Dick's life occurred in August of 1949 when he married the love of his life, the beautiful, kind, generous and loving Barbara Ann Levin. Their marriage happily lasted for over two thirds of a century and was still going strong at the time of his passing. Their marriage produced three children, Richard Jr. married to Pam, Jeanne Ellen married to Ken and younger son Douglas. Four grandchildren round out the family: Rachel, Casey, Alexandra and Arden. He looked forward to spending time at his home on Long Beach Island, playing tennis, and tending to his garden. He spent many happy days there with his family and friends. He served his country; he served his public; but most importantly he was a devoted family man. He will be greatly missed. A funeral service will be held on Friday, April 15, 2016 at 12:00pm at the Bernheim, Apter Kreitzman Suburban Funeral Chapel, 68 Old Short Hills Rd., Livingston, NJ. There will be a reception to follow at 40 W. Park Place, Morristown, NJ. The family asks that donations in lieu of flowers be sent to the Atlantic Healthcare Foundation, Morristown, NJ, the New Jersey Healthcare Foundation, Millburn, NJ or a charity of your choice. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-13T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  AMSTER, RICHARD L."}, "print_page": "23", "snippet": "AMSTER--Richard L.,a resident of Morristown, NJ died on April 10, 2016.
