Dan grew up in Cleveland, the son of Ezra and Sylvia Shapiro. He moved to New York to attend Columbia College and Law School, and received a Fulbright fellowship at the London School of Economics. He married the former Ellen Spingarn in 1964. In 1969, he co-founded the law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel, which grew to become a top firm with hundreds of attorneys. Dan was a pioneering tax and investment lawyer, particularly in the hedge fund industry, and last year won The Hedge Fund Journal Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Hedge Fund Industry. Over the last decade, he was also a partner in the investment firm Park Vale Capital. In 2002, he and his wife Ellen moved to London to open an office of Schulte Roth & Zabel and continued to live there while maintaining their residence in New York. Dan was a life-long leader in the Jewish community, serving as President of New York's Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and a founder of the Jewish Community Relations Council. He also served as Secretary of the New York City Partnership and on the Board of Governors and Executive Committee of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. He spearheaded the 1986 merger of UJA and Federation of Jewish Philanthropies to become UJA Federation of New York. Dan loved music and singing, which he did frequently, playing tennis at Century Country Club, and spending time with his family and friends. Besides his wife Ellen, Dan is survived by his beloved sister Rena Olshansky of Cleveland and by three sons and seven grandchildren, who were his proudest achievement: Jonathan and his children Journey and Jasper; Andrew, his wife Nina, and their children Eliza, William, and Charlotte; and Peter, his wife Rebecca, and their children Roxy and Simon.
