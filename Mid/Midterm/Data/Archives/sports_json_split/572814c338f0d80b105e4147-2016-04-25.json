Age 85. Died April 22, after visiting with many of his dearest family members. Loving husband of Bernice (nee Rubinstein), father of Lisa and Richard, father-in-law of Randy Sloan, devoted grandfather of Jason and Rachel, brother, brother-in-law, uncle, cousin, and friend (in many cases lifelong). Born August 1930 in Brooklyn. He moved during childhood to Passaic, NJ, where he returned to raise his family and practice medicine after the University of Pennsylvania and New York University Medical School, and serving as a physician in the peace-time Air Force (in Morocco). He was a very respected Internist and Cardiologist, partnering with Irving Ehrenfeld and Alvin Ehrlich to form the Passaic Internal Medicine Group, and attending at Passaic General and Beth Israel Hospitals. In 40 years of practice, he earned his patients' appreciation because of his cardiology expertise, kindness and availability. He also was ahead of his time in recognizing the role of psychological factors in contributing to heart disease and communicated this understanding in his care. He was a passionate collector (stamps, antique toy cars, brass microscopes), horticulturalist, swimmer, traveler, and Brooklyn Dodgers fan. He moved to Upper Montclair, NJ in 1978, but remained hugely proud of his Passaic background. He was an active University of Pennsylvania and NYU Medical alumnus. He touched many lives as a family man, friend, and physician. We will miss him greatly. Funeral services will be held Tuesday, April 26th at 11am, at the Jewish Chapel, 841 Allwood Road, Clifton, NJ. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-25T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MOSKOWITZ, DR"}, "print_page": "07", "snippet": "MOSKOWITZ--Dr. Robert Lawrence.
