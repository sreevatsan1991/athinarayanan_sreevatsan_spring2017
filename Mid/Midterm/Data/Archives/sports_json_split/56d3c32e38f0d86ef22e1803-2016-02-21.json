Born in Manhattan on May 15, 1941 to the late Patrick and Nora Carroll, Kevin grew up in Staten Island, N.Y. He later lived in New Jersey, in Franklin Lakes, Montclair, then Cedar Grove, before taking up residency in Scottsdale, Ariz. Kevin had an illustrious career on Wall Street, and retired as CEO of Gintelco, Inc. A true leader and very community-minded, he served on the boards of the Montclair YMCA and Turning Point Addiction Treatment Center, and was a former President of the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center. He was a longtime member of the Montclair Golf Club, in West Orange, N.J., and the Desert Mountain Club, in Scottsdale. He enjoyed all sports, played football and basketball throughout his school years, and was recruited to play professional football in Montreal. He later competed in tennis and paddle tournaments for the Indian Trail Club, in Franklin Lakes, and became a single- digit golfer. Kevin loved the outdoors, completing three Outward Bound trips, including climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa. He was an avid reader with a love of the English language and was a true gentleman with great charm, intellect, integrity and a wonderful sense of humor. Kevin was unfailingly loyal to family and friends, and proud of his Irish heritage. Predeceased by his son, Kevin (K.J.) Carroll, he is survived by his loving family: wife, Bonnie Strauss Carroll; daughter, Melanie C. Morrice (Peter), of Connecticut; grandsons, Ryan and Gavin; brother, James Carroll, of South Carolina; adored nieces and nephews; extended family, and dear friends. A celebration of life will be held in the future.
