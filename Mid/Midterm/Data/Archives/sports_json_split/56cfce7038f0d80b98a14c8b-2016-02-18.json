The Community Service Society (CSS) mourns the death of Alvin L. Schorr, 94, who served as General Director of CSS from 1973 to 1977, and received many awards and honors over a distinguished career fighting poverty on many fronts. He died on February 13, in Charlotte, NC. Born in New York City in 1921, Mr. Schorr graduated from City College of New York and Washington University in St. Louis where he received his Master's Degree in Social Work. After working for several years in social service agencies he began a career in policy. In 1963, he headed up analysis of poverty in the United States with a focus on the relationship of family and income development. Two years later he moved to the Office of Economic Opportunity where he did research, planning and allocation of government funds in the fight against poverty. By 1968, Schorr was a professor of social policy and director of the Center for Studies of Income Maintenance Policy at Brandeis University. He would later establish a similar center at New York University where he served as dean of the School of Social Work from 1970 to 1973. When he took over CSS in 1973, the anti-poverty organization was transitioning from an agency working primarily with disadvantaged families to one focused on aiding the poor in their own communities -- in housing projects, schools, community centers and neighborhoods. Among the many awards Schorr received was the Distinguished Service Award (1966), the Distinguished Alumnus Citation (1970) from Washington University's George Warren Brown School of Social Work, the Michael Schwerner award for civil rights leadership (1972), and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Adelphi University (1975). He was a Fulbright Senior Research Scholar in England in 1962-63. With great sadness we mark his death, and extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-18T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  SCHORR, ALVIN L"}, "print_page": "18", "snippet": "SCHORR-- Alvin L.
