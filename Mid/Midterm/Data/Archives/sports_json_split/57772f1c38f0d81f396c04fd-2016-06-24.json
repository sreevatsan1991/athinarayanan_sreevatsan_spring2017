He was 77 years old. Born in Phoenix, he was the son of Rose G. and Bertrand A. Diamond; and grandson of Nathan Diamond, pioneer merchant, who co-founded one of Arizona's early department stores.

Throughout his career Mr. Diamond lived in New York with his wife of 52 years, Susan. He was a senior officer of the Dun & Bradstreet Corp (now retired) the majority of his business career.
