An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it \"wrapped itself around me and never let go.\" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard. His private life was just as rich. He married the woman he loved at first sight, loved her deeply to the end, and together they presided over a family of four beautiful children, Kristina Wallison, Claude Davies, John Kaplan and Emily Kaplan, and eight grandchildren. All grieve profoundly at his passing, but feel deeply blessed to have loved and been loved by this remarkable man. The family will receive friends at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue (at 81st Street) in New York City, on Thursday, January 7 at 2-5pm and 7-9pm.
