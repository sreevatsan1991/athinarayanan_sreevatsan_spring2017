He was born in Lancaster, PA, but was a lifelong resident of New York City and Fire Island. A graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Yale University (1956) and the University of Pennsylvania Law School (1959), he practiced law with Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy for a number of years, during which time he also served in the U.S. Army reserve. His great love was the theater and he was the consummate theatergoer and supporter, not only attending plays but providing financial support to a number of off-Broadway plays over the years. He served on several non-profit boards, including Urban Stages and Plays for Living. He had a wonderful sense of humor, was a marvelous pianist and a very talented photographer, was a most loyal friend and possessed a gift for bringing people together. He had a magnificent collection of motion pictures on tape and disc, which he organized alphabetically by studio. He was a member of Holland Lodge No. 8, F. & A.M. and for a number of years was a member of The Players and The Yale Club of New York City. John is survived by his brother, Paul A. Mueller, Jr. and his wife, Jane, of Lancaster, and three nieces, Anne M. Leahy, Southern Pines, NC, Catherine M. Boyer, Oxford, New Zealand, and Elizabeth G. Mueller, La Jolla, CA, and four grand-nieces and a grand-nephew. He was buried in a private ceremony in Lancaster. A memorial service will be scheduled in New York City in the spring.
