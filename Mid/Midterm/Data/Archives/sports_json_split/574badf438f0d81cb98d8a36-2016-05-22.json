Al was born, lived and, for most of his career, worked in the Bronx. Aware of the atrocities occurring in Europe during WWII, he enlisted in the Air Force and served as a fighter pilot. His commitment to avenging and protecting the Jewish people remained a passion of his for the rest of his life. After the war, Al earned a BS in economics from Long Island University and an MA from Columbia Teachers College. In September 1953, he began his thirty-four year career in the NYC Public Schools teaching Social Studies in Junior High School 52. It was a perfect fit. History was his favorite subject. His extensive knowledge, keen memory and ability to speak extemporaneously made him a captivating teacher. After teaching for ten years, Al became assistant principal of Community Schools 54 and later 77. He was also the principal of several summer school programs. Al was a wise, supportive and diligent administrator. He was cherished by the staff in every school he worked. He never took a sick day! Al was an erudite man. He had many interests and hobbies that fulfilled his long life, including studying and investing in the stock market, collecting coins, playing chess and cards, gardening, painting, photography, classical music, opera, traveling. Al was a natural athlete. As a youngster, his baseball skills were good enough to earn him a tryout for a professional baseball team! He played tennis until he was 88! Al was a good natured, honest and gracious gentleman. He had a wonderful sense of humor and sharp memory that enabled him to recall and tell countless jokes at every occasion and at just the right time! Al is survived and sorely missed by his beloved wife, Blanche (of 65 years), devoted daughters Barbara, Laura (Stuart), Nancy (Joseph), loving sister Rosalind, six grandchildren, one great-grandson, a niece and nephew. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GROSSER, ALAN (AL)"}, "print_page": "24", "snippet": "GROSSER--Alan (Al), died on September 4, 2015 at 92.
