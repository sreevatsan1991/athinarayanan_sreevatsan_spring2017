The NYU School of Law mourns the death of University Professor Jerome \"Jerry\" Bruner. One of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century, Jerry was also a trailblazing figure in a multitude of other fields. Bringing his innate and abundant sense of wonder about the human mind to the Law School, he interwove psychology, literature, philosophy, anthropology--practically every aspect of the humanities--into his teaching. For his students and fellow teachers alike, he illuminated ways in which culture and law intersect. In a tribute for his 100th birthday last October, his colleagues hailed him as the \"Pied Piper of interdisciplinary wonder.\" The Law School will deeply miss Jerry's dazzling intellect and personal warmth, but we are grateful for the ways in which he enriched our community. We join his family and friends in mourning his loss.
