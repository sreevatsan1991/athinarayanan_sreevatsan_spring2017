Predeceased by her beloved brother Bill and sister Isabel Rader. Survived by Ted Levine, her loving and devoted husband of 62 years, her daughter Carol (Tim), her sons Alex (Joyce) and Jim (Lisa), seven adoring grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and friends and relatives around the country. Rosalie was a whirlwind at work and at home. A graduate of Erasmus Hall High School and Brooklyn College, she took great pride in being Professor Harold Groves' first female Ph.D. student in the Economics Department at the University of Wisconsin. She went on to a long career at C.W. Post College, where she was respected as a superb teacher and, later, as an able and farsighted administrator. In retirement, she worked with countless boards, commissions, committees and volunteer organizations large and small, often mentoring younger colleagues. Her love of her large extended family showed in her five decades of hosting innumerable parties in Manhasset, Shelter Island, Manhattan and Princeton. It now takes a large team to pull off the Thanksgiving and Passover meals that she made all by herself. She traveled widely with curiosity and joy, and was a longtime supporter of the New York City Ballet. We will miss her terribly and remember her fondly.
