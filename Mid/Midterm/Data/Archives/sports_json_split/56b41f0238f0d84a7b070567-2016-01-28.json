Sinai Medical School, died on Monday at 79. Born in Montreal, he attended McGill University, edited The McGill Daily, and earned his M.D. at the University of Saskatchewan, where he met Mary, his wife of 54 years. As head of Psychiatry for the New York City Welfare Department under Mayor Koch, he waged a prescient fight against the impending homeless crisis. His patients ranged from celebrities to the indigent, and he was deeply committed to each one as an individual. A broad smile and a winning sense of humor told you instantly that you were in the presence of someone who would sympathetically take the full measure of your being. His stamina was superhuman; he worked long hours and still made himself available round the clock until the day he entered the hospital. His involvement was uncommonly broad, running from child to geriatric, from drugs and talk therapy, to being a pioneer in public psychiatry. Lover of hootenannies, Leadbelly, and opera; gourmet and wine connoisseur; tennis player and fan; magnanimous host and storyteller, Dr. Reich is survived by Mary, two children, Jim and Sharon, and three grandchildren.
