The World Jewish Congress mourns the passing of a giant, a committed philanthropist, world-renowned publisher of authors including Vladimir Nabokov, articulate advocate of the Jewish people and fearless defender of the Jewish State of Israel. George Weidenfeld grew up in Vienna and fled Austria after the Nazi takeover in 1938. Because he was saved by a Christian family, George never forgot that his life was spared by Christians and just last year, he created a foundation to rescue thousands of persecuted Christians in the Middle East. This man never forgot his debts and always repaid them. As an immigrant during World War II, George became an integral part of the BBC World Service and broadcast reports in several languages. In 1969, Queen Elizabeth acknowledged Britain's appreciation and knighted him, followed by a life peerage in the House of Lords in 1976. Last April, at the age of 95, Lord Weidenfeld was awarded the WJC's Theodor Herzl Award in London and became an honorary vice-president of the World Jewish Congress. There are few people in the entire world who have spoken out with more courage against injustice. Our dear friend George was one. He was one of the most inspiring and accomplished figures of the 20th and 21st centuries. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Annabelle, daughter Laura, grandchildren and great grandchildren. We will miss him deeply. World Jewish Congress President Ronald S.
