Died at home on June 6th at age 98. Award-winning author of non-fiction for young adults; enthusiastic wife, mother, grandmother and friend. Raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. After graduating from Adelphi College in 1937, Rhoda became a \"career girl\". She produced several programs for CBS radio and later wrote feature articles for several national magazines. In 1944, she met Gerald Blumberg, a successful attorney, and they married six months later. Moving from Brooklyn in 1951 to a farm in what was then a rural part of Westchester County, Rhoda dedicated the next 20+ years to raising their four children. She enjoyed teaching her children the joys of nature and sharing her passion for classical music, travel and tennis. When her youngest child entered college in the early 1970s, her interest in history and the exhilaration of research triumphed, and Rhoda returned to her typewriter. During the next 30 years, she wrote and composed over 25 non-fiction books. She had an uncanny ability to find and incorporate fascinating anecdotes that brought history to life for millions of young adults (and their parents). Her books received numerous awards, including the Boston Globe Horn Book Award, the Newbery Honor Medal, Orbis Pictus Award for Outstanding Non-Fiction for Children, and multiple Golden Kite awards. Her books included \"Commodore Perry in the Land of the Shogun\" (1985), \"The Incredible Journey of Lewis and Clark\" (1987), \"The Great American Gold Rush\" (1989), \"Shipwrecked! The True Adventures of a Japanese Boy\" (2001), and \"York's Adventures with Lewis and Clark: An African-American's Part in the Great Expedition\" (2004). Rhoda also partnered on several books with friend and renowned illustrator, Murray Tinkelman, including \"The Truth About Dragons\" (1980) and \"Backyard Bestiary\" (1979). Jerry Blumberg died in 2009 shortly after their 64th wedding anniversary. Rhoda's life is celebrated by a large family, including four children and their spouses: Larry Blumberg and Robin Lynn, Rena Blumberg, Alice and David Rubin, and Leda Blumberg and Steve Cole; nine grandchildren: Daniel Blumberg, Carla Steckman, Ilana Blumberg, William Gottlieb, Osheana Tashombe, Gregory Rubin, Amalia Rubin, Dana Rocco and Eliza Volk; ten great-grand- children; and her best friend and sister, Cynthia. She is the last to pass of her Adelphi College gang: Betty, Estelle, Gladys, Mickey, Mimi, and Norma. Funeral will be on Friday, June 10, 2016 at 11am at Temple Israel of Northern Westchester, Glengary Road, Croton-on-Hudson, NY. Burial will follow at Sharon Gardens Cemetery, Valhalla, New York. Shiva plans will be announced at the funeral. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-09T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  BLUMBERG, RHODA"}, "print_page": "15", "snippet": "BLUMBERG--Rhoda.
