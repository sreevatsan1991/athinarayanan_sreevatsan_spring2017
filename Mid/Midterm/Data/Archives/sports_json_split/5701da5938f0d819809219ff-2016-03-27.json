She grew up in Ocean City, NJ and the Philadelphia suburbs. Gloria attended the University of Pennsylvania before marrying Hiram Gates Larmon, founder of Larmon Photo, Inc., camera stores in the Delaware Valley. They met after she left a note on his classic Packard parked outside his first store at the Avenue of Shops in Jenkintown, PA. Five years after Hiram's early death in 1963, Gloria married Ralph Warren Hoerner, MD, an allergist and emeritus for 57 years at Abington Memorial Hospital. They enjoyed many happy times traveling, including frequent cruises aboard the QE2. A wannabee golfer and an avid bridge player, Gloria was on the First Team at Huntingdon Valley Country Club for over forty years. She served as the First Team bridge chairman and for twenty-three years wrote the bridge column for the club's monthly newsletter. Later in life, Gloria earned her real estate license and joined John Tener Garbutt, Inc. She was especially skilled in helping people find their perfect home. Gloria was a member of Huntingdon Valley Country Club and the Two Century Trap Club where she served as scorekeeper. Early in her marriage to Hiram, she joined the Junior Colony Club of Ambler where she served as vice president. In a theater performance at the club, she stole the show as a distracted, gum-chewing secretary. Gloria is survived by two daughters, Carol and Barbara, two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital would be most appreciated. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-27T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  HOERNER, GLORIA LARMON"}, "print_page": "22", "snippet": "HOERNER--Gloria Larmon, age 89, passed away peacefully in her sleep on February 2, 2016.
