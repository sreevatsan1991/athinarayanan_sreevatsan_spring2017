(1925-2016). Manhattan School of Music and its Board of Trustees are profoundly saddened by the passing of Alan M. Ades, a successful entrepreneur and deeply committed philanthropist who was a great friend to MSM and an influential force for progress at the School. A Trustee Emeritus who served as a member of the School's Board of Trustees for 21 years between 1990 and 2011, Mr. Ades, along with his wife Joan Taub Ades, made many profound contributions to MSM over the years, ensuring the School's advancement as one of the world's leading independent music conservatories. In addition to his important service as a member of MSM's Board, Mr. Ades' stewardship was reflected in his active commitment to the many MSM committees of which he was a member and by the generous leadership contributions he and Mrs. Ades made to the School, often by way of the Joan and Alan Ades-Taub Family Foundation. Many of Mr. Ades' most significant contributions to MSM were guided by his love of opera (he also served as a director at the Met Opera and Santa Fe Opera). In addition to providing generous support to MSM scholarships for classical vocalists, the Ades Family Foundation established and continues to fund the School's prestigious Alan M. and Joan Taub Ades Vocal Competition, an annual event that is judged by an esteemed panel of opera professionals and awards significant cash prizes to winning students. Perhaps most significant, Mr. and Mrs. Ades led the capital campaign for, and ultimately named, one of MSM's key performance and rehearsal spaces, an indispensable, flexible black-box space that not only accommodates full-scale opera and orchestral rehearsals, but also seats audiences of up to 200 for a wide variety of performances. This key addition to MSM's facility-the Alan M. and Joan Taub Ades Performance Space-opened its doors in 2007 and stands as a lively testament to the visionary leadership and generosity made to MSM by this prominent leader in business and philanthropy and his wife, Joan Taub Ades. Our Board of Trustees, Administration, Faculty, Alumni, and Current Students are united in expressing the MSM Community's sorrow at the passing of this singular individual. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Ades, whose continuing friendship we so highly cherish, and to the Ades family; we know that Alan's long, rich, accomplished life and the many wonderful memories it inspires will be a source of comfort and joy in the days and years ahead.
