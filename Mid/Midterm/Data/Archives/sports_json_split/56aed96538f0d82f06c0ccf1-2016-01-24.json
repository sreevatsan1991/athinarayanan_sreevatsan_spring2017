Awarded her Doctorate of Hebrew Literature at age 66, Dr. Zielenziger was instrumental in creating the curriculum for teaching the books of Genesis and Exodus in Conservative Judaism at the Melton Research Center of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. The Melton program emphasized critical inquiry and the study of Bible for character education. She was a proponent of studying the creation myths and texts of other Middle Eastern cultures in order to better understand the context in which the Bible was written. Born in London, the daughter of Leo and Lola Herrmann, ardent Zionists, she grew up in Jerusalem before the founding of the Jewish state, and served as an ambulance driver and chauffeur in the British Army during World War II, where her fluency in Hebrew, English and German was invaluable. After the War, she attended the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she met a German emigre and fellow student, Yehuda Pfeuffer, whom she renamed Yehuda Amichai. Amichai went on to become Israel's most celebrated poet, and the first drafts of many of his most enduring poems were composed as letters exchanged between the two. Amichai's letters to Dr. Zielenziger are now archived at Ben Gurion University in Israel. She moved to New York in 1947, to study at the Teachers Institute of the Seminary. While in New York she met and subsequently married Eric W. Zielenziger, a German Jewish survivor of the Holocaust who escaped the Nazis by living underground in Amsterdam for more than two years. They had two children. For 34 years, Dr. Zielenziger taught education at the Jewish Theological Seminary, after teaching for many years in Hebrew schools in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Before relocating to Riverdale in their later years the Zielenzigers lived primarily in Freeport and Great Neck, NY. She is survived by her sons David, of Great Neck, and Michael (Diane Abt) of Oakland, CA and Manhattan and a brother, Dr. Gabriel Herrmann of Jerusalem. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-24T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  ZIELENZIGER, DR"}, "print_page": "19", "snippet": "ZIELENZIGER--Dr. Ruth, who helped change how Conservative Jews in America are taught the Bible, and inspired some of Israel's most enduring poetry of love while a young woman, died Thursday at the RiverWalk independent living facility of the Hebrew Home in the Bronx, one day shy of her 93rd birthday.
