Herbert Rothchild, lifelong New Yorker, passed away on October 27, 2015 in the company of his children. His beloved wife Florence, to whom he had been married for 67 years, predeceased him by two days. He is survived by his daughters Betsy Lessans (Jay), Barbara Waxman (Richard), Jane Rothchild (Adell Donaghue), grandsons Steven Lessans (Stacey), David Oshry, and Philip Lessans, and great-granddaughter Sophia Lessans. He is also survived by his brother Joseph, his sisters-in law Shirley, Ellen and Gloria, and many nephews, nieces and friends. Herb was born in Borough Park on December 27, 1921 to Philip and Yetta (Fisch). He attended yeshiva in Brooklyn, and was a graduate of Bernard Baruch College of the City of New York. He considered his greatest achievements in life to have been his family, his Army service during World War II in the Signal Corps as a cryptographer, his successful business career with his brother, Joe, in the family business, Rothchild Printing Company, and his passionate support for the State of Israel through his work with the United Jewish Appeal. He was loyal and devoted to the people he loved, and he inspired loyalty and devotion in others. Herb maintained friendships with his employees and professional colleagues well after he retired. Herb loved to travel and he loved fly-fishing, particularly on the Snake River in Wyoming. He and Florence enjoyed opera, classical music, and theater, and supported New York institutions devoted to them all. He was an avid reader of anything related to Civil War history and Abraham Lincoln. He can best be described as an authentic man of integrity who was modest and had a great sense of humor. He was fond of a good dirty limerick, especially those he penned himself. We miss him. Donations in his memory may be made to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinsons Research or to the New York Public Library. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  ROTHCHILD, HERBERT"}, "print_page": "22", "snippet": "ROTHCHILD--Herbert.
