Recognized as a leading authority in his field, he achieved many research and clinical breakthroughs in renovascular hypertension, renal physiology and genitourinary surgery, and served as president of the American Urological Association, the American Foundation for Urologic Diseases and the American Board of Urology. For his remarkable contributions to the field, he received numerous prestigious awards, including the 39th Ferdinand C. Valentine Award from the New York Academy of Medicine, the Gold Cystoscope and Ramon Guiteras Award from the American Urological Association and the esteemed Barringer Medal from the American Association of Genitourinary Surgeons. He also received the Maurice R. Greenberg Distinguished Service Award from NewYork- Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in 2002. In addition to his efforts in urology, he was a Senior Associate Dean at Weill Cornell and was a founding leader of Weill Cornell Medicine's Physician Organization, helping to expand its presence throughout New York City.
