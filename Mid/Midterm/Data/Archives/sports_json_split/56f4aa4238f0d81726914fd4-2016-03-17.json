The Board and Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art express with profound sadness the passing of beloved Trustee Steven Ames. A passionate collector and supporter of the arts, Steve served as a Trustee of the Whitney Museum for nearly two decades. He served on numerous Board Committees but above all he was dedicated to building the collection. As Chair successively of the Photography and Drawing Acquisition Committees, Steve stewarded the Museum's collection with curiosity, a keen eye, a deep understanding of the Whitney's mission and a commitment to new art. He and his wife Ann gave dozens of works to the collection by artists including: George Condo, Mark Grotjahn, Roni Horn, Matthew Barney and Hiroshi Sugimoto. Steve was a quiet presence and a thoughtful leader yet with a strong voice. His many contributions to the Whitney on behalf of the artists he championed will be missed but not forgotten. We are immensely proud that Steve's legacy will also continue through the establishment of the Steven and Ann Ames Curator of Drawings--a position he endowed in 2012. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to his devoted wife Ann, children David and Marja Ames, Adam and Elissa Ames, David and Linna Sica, his three beloved grandchildren, extended family and many friends with whom he shared his life.
