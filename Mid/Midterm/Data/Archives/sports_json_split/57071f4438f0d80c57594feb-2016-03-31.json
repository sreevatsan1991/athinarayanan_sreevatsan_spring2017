Jerome Siegel lived a long and meaningful life. Born May 24, 1917, to Henry and Sophie Siegel, nee Ginsberg, in Newark, NJ, he was educated at Erasmus High School; graduated with a BS from City College, NY, and an MBA (1939) from Harvard Business School; and was a Lieutenant in the US Navy during WWII. Jerome married Jeanne Siegel in 1940 and had two daughters, Elizabeth and Carol, both of New York City. Jerome married Ruth Leff Levin in 1967 and they remained lovingly married until her death in 2011. Together they had one child, Henry Jonathan Siegel of New York City. Ruth's children, Michael, Stephen, Robin and Bill, all became part of Jerome's extended family of seven, as did their children's spouses, Talia, David, Laurence, Sharon, and Amy, as well as Luis Batista. Altogether, Jerome and Ruth had 17 adoring grandchildren. Jerome, a lifelong entrepreneur, founded The Titan Industrial Corporation in 1947 and built it to become a major player in global steel and commodity markets, receiving the famed E Award in 1965 for the largest independently owned U.S. exporting company. Jerome also founded Henry Realty, a firm focused on real estate and other ventures and investments. Jerome had too many achievements to mention all, but he was especially proud of his active Board role at Big Brothers/Big Sisters of NYC for over 20 years where he recently funded the Urban Assembly School for Global Commerce in Harlem, as well as his Board service and philanthropy involving The Ruth Leff Siegel Awards for Excellence in Pancreatic Cancer Research, Westchester Community College, Sarah Lawrence College, and The Weizmann Institute of Science. He was also proud of his long relationship with the Democratic Party, and especially President Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Congresswoman Nita Lowey, and Senator Chuck Schumer. Jerome was a lifelong athlete and member of Quaker Ridge Golf Club, Beach Point Club, The Lotos Club, La Romana Country Club, The Harmonie Club, The Harvard Club of NYC, and the New Rochelle Tennis Club. He especially enjoyed the many tennis doubles trophies he won with Ruth and with Henry. He was an avid golfer and card player, and played bridge throughout his life. Jerome was an incredible father and grandfather, a fantastic friend, and a lover of life. He was a legendary leader for his family, friends, community and business associates, who led an active, engaged life up to his final moments. Funeral service will be held at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale on Friday, April 1 at noon.
