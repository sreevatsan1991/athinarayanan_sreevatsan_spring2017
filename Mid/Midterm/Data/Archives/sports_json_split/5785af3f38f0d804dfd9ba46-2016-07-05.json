She was preceded in death by her sister, Jean Hester. Carol was born October 2, 1939 in Staten Island, NY to Lorna and Robert Schoenfeld. She attended Nathan Hale High School (West Allis, WI) and earned degrees from The University of Wisconsin (B.S. 1961), Manhattanville College (B.A. 1989), and Columbia University (M.S. 1992). As a young woman, she worked as a physical therapist in San Francisco and London and participated in a cultural exchange program in Italy. Back in Wisconsin, she met a widower with a little girl named Suzanne, a German accent, and a briefcase full of ambition. She and Hans were married in July 1965 and welcomed John and Tina over the next two years. Hans would go on to be the CFO of Philip Morris for 17 years. Carol shared her love of the performing arts, especially ballet and opera, with her children and grandchildren. She was actively involved in their schools and loved attending performances, competitions and horse shows, even across the miles. She was a great supporter of many charities and a volunteer social worker for Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City for many years. She loved to travel and learn about archeology. Her beautiful photos of architecture, exotic animals and children from around the world are family treasures.
