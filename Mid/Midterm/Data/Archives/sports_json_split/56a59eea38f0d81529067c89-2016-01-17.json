During his tenure there, he served as Assistant Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences (1959-1962) and department chair (1961-1970). He also wrote a successful introductory psychology textbook.

He is predeceased by his wife of 63 years, Margaret Takacs Silverman. He is survived by his brother, Perry Silverman, two daughters, Pamela Silverman and Jill Silverman, and four grandchildren.
