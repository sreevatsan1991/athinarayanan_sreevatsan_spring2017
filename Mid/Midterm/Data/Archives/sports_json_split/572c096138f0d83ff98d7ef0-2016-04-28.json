He was born in Houston on October 7, 1936 to Ardon B. Judd, Sr. and Sallie Reynolds Matthews. He married Nancy Ruina (\"Rue\") Wallace on June 5, 1965, and they raised their two daughters, Nancy Alston Judd and Sallie Matthews Judd, in Arlington, Virginia. A graduate of Episcopal High School (Virginia), Denison, and the University of Texas School of Law, Ardon enjoyed a successful career in both government service and in the private sector, where he spent over 30 years as an executive at Dresser Industries. He was a natural joiner, and in equal measures took joy from and gave joy to all around him. Ardon is survived by a large and loving family: his wife Rue, daughters Nancy and husband Barclay Armstrong, of Houston, and Sallie and husband Justin Abelow, of New York; sisters Sally Ann Judd Harrison and Susan Judd Brown and husband, Joseph C. Brown; grandchildren John Armstrong, Alston Armstrong, Judd Armstrong, Campbell Abelow, Elizabeth Abelow, and a legion of adoring nieces and nephews, cousins and friends. All are fortunate to have known him. A Memorial Service will be held at Christ Church Cathedral, Houston, Friday, April 29, at 11:00am with interment in the family cemetery at Reynolds Bend, Lambshead Ranch, Albany, Texas.
