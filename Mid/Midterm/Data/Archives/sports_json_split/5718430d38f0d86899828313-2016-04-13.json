We mourn the passing of Fountain House Board Member, Hamilton F. Kean. Mr. Kean was elected to the Board in 1966 and, until his death, faithfully served in many capacities. He was a tireless advocate for those living with serious mental illness and a wise and caring leader of our organization. With the growth of the Fountain House community throughout his tenure as a Director, he provided guidance and leadership in addressing the challenges confronting the Board and the needs of Fountain House members. His commitment and clarity of vision were matched by his considerable kindness, grace, and warmth. The Fountain House community will miss him greatly, but his immeasurable contributions will be a lasting gift to us all. We express our sympathy to Ham's wife and our dear friend, Edie Kean, to Thomas H. Kean, a member of the Fountain House of New Jersey Board of Directors, and to the entire Kean family. Nancy L.
