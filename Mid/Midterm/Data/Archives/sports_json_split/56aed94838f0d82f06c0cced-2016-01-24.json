Jerry was a director of Recognition Equipment Company, inventor of the bar code and digital reading technology as well as Tessco Technologies Inc. a major electronics distribution company (1982-2007). In the entertainment world, Jerry was the chairman of United Screen Arts from 1966-1973. In finance, Jerry was Chairman and CEO of ISI Corporation (1967-1977), owner of the Life Insurance Company of California (innovator of the universal life insurance product), Windsor Life (U.K), and World Wide Life Assurance Co. (U.K.) which, together, were later sold to EF Hutton. Jerry was a long serving director of Telecredit Inc., a technology-enabler of the credit card industry (later acquired by Equifax) and was a director of the First National Iron Bank of Morristown New Jersey. Jerry was a limited partner of Alex Brown & Sons (Baltimore, MD) from 1982-1984, and a principal in Olympic Capital Partners, a Seattle based investment group (1995-2000).
