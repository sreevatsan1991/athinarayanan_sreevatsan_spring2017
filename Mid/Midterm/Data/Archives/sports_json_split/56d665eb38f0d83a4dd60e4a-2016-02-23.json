Predeceased by his beloved wife Jeanne Epstein, M.D., a brother, Edward Myles, and dear Epstein family in-laws; survived by his daughter Anne of Waterloo, IA, and loving nieces and nephews. A graduate of Cornell University and SUNY Downstate College of Medicine, he was medical director of the Robert Yeager Health Center in Pomona, NY, and earlier was medical director of French Hospital as well as a physician at NYU and in private practice. The world's most devoted husband, father, and Giants fan, he loved the practice of medicine, fishing, nature, and photography --but most of all took pleasure in caring for, talking to, and helping out his family and friends. Visitation will be from 10 to 11am, service at 11am Wednesday, February 24, at Smith, Seaman & Quackenbush Funeral Home, Monroe, NY.
