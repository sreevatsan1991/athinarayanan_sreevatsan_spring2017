Born November 13, 1931, beloved husband to his Bryant High School, Astoria sweetheart, Patricia (Goss), for 62 years, and family man to the core. Enlisted in Air Force at age 19, became one of New York's Bravest, member of Engine 54 and Ladder 4 for two decades. Moved to Tarpon Springs, FL in 1978, joined Emergency Service unit at St. Petersburg Clearwater Airport. With jet black hair, dark eyes and an ever-present, warm smile, Tom was still most recognized by his bright and cheerful personality. Young in spirit and body, he was suddenly challenged by a stroke in 2013. His quiet strength, love of life and incredible courage led to an epic battle that inspired all who witnessed it. His courage was only matched by his kindness, and he leaves a mark that extends far beyond his large family. Predeceased by his sister Josephine Roy. In addition to his wife, Pat, survived by his sister Anne Chatterton of Pinehurst, NC; his five children: T.R. (Patricia) of Naples, FL, Laura Glading (Randy) of Waccabuc, NY, Jennifer Steffes (Mark) of Morrison, CO, Patty Wolfe of Orlando, FL, and Francis (Alison) of Rye, NY; and, most proudly, 12 grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.
