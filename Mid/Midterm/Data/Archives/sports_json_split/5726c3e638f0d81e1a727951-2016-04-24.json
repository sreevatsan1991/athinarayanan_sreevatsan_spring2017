Mr. Peck was a quintessential New Yorker. Born in Brooklyn, he attended the Lawrenceville School and Princeton University, where he graduated in 1957. Mr. Peck made his career in real estate but loved his time spent in the philanthropic world as President of the Peter Jay Sharp Foundation. He was a generous, vibrant, fascinating man who liked giving back to the city he loved. He was a witty raconteur whose stories touched the hearts of many. He will be sorely missed. He is survived by his wife, Liliane; a son, Ian; a daughter, Dominique; a sister, Roberta; and three grandchildren. A private funeral will be held, and a memorial open to all will take place at All Souls Church at a later date. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in his honor to the Parrish Art Museum, to which he devoted much time. http://parrishart.org/support. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-24T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  PECK, NORMAN LLOYD"}, "print_page": "24", "snippet": "PECK--Norman Lloyd, passed peacefully on April 16, 2016, surrounded by family and friends, after a short battle with melanoma.
