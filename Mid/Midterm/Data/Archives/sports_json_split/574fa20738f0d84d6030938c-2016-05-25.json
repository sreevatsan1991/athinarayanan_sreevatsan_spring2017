I am deeply saddened at the passing of \"Mr. Papert\". He was my fearless leader for the last 17 years of his illustrious tenure as Founder and President of 42nd Street Development Corporation. I learned invaluable lessons from him -- lessons that I didn't learn in college or graduate school. Papert taught me how to fight for what I believe in and to never, never give up. He liked it when I stood up to him appropriately. Working for Mr. Papert was like listening to an autobiography and the history of the city he loved. Although he was known as a demanding champion of preservation and renewal, Mr. Papert was an avid supporter of the arts and culture. He was a writer with quick wit and intellect. Mr. Papert loved his horses and the races. I knew the charming, gentle and compassionate Mr. Papert. He enjoyed gazing at the beauty of the earth as he drove his red BMW out to his beach home in Quogue. Mr. Papert loved his family and friends and his famous \"lunch dates\". I had a special relationship with Mr. Papert and I won't forget him. I will always remember his humor, his intellect and his books. Thank you Mr. Papert for being a great teacher. You had a long run here. You touched the lives of many. You were gifted with a charmed and highly productive life. Well done, Fred Papert. Well Done. Jacqui L.
