George was born on April 2, 1932, in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania. He lost his father in a Pennsylvania coal mining accident at a young age, and he was raised by his mother and her siblings. He served in the Army in Korea and attended Villanova University graduating in 1954. He married Margaret McNamara, and they raised three children - Agnes, Karen and George. His careers in publishing and advertising took him to Pennsylvania, Chicago, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. The passions he had for his Lithuanian heritage, fishing, Villanova basketball and a beer at his \"local\" were only surpassed by the love for his family. George was always there with a well told story, wise words of advice and a joke to those who encountered his company. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and four grandchildren. George will be dearly remembered and missed. A Memorial Mass will be held on June 11, 2016 at 9:30am at the Catholic Center at NYU.
