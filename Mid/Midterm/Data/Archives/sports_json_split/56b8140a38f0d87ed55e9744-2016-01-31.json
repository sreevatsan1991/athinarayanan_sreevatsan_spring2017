He was born in New York City on February 10, 1917 and attended New York University. Bernard was predeceased by his wife of 69 years, Laura Redfield Levy, who shared a love of life, travel, and dogs. He is survived by his sons Dean (Janice), Jonathan (Carol), and daughter Marcia Roesch (Geoffrey), and his seven grandchildren and six greatgrandchildren). Bernard was one of the most prominent dealers in early American furniture, first as a partner in the firm of Ginsburg & Levy, founded in 1901, and then from 1973 until his death with the firm Bernard & S. Dean Levy, Inc., of New York. Over the nearly 70 years as an active dealer, he was able to acquire and place a number of the most recognizable pieces in both private and public collections. He was a friend and advisor to many of the great early collectors, many of whose gifts now form the core of major museum collections. These include The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Bayou Bend Collection, The Winterthur Museum and Historic Deerfield among many other institutions. He was always eager to share his knowledge and enthusiasm with collectors, curators, other dealers and especially his family. His eye for the very finest in Americana will be missed. Bernard was an avid and accomplished tennis player winning many local and regional tournaments. Into his seventies he remained active in competitive tennis attaining a national ranking. Anyone who played with or against him can attest to a strong will and a wicked drop shot. Also, he always had a good joke to tell and enjoyed making others laugh. He will be greatly missed. A celebration of his life will be held at a later date. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-31T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LEVY, BERNARD"}, "print_page": "25", "snippet": "LEVY--Bernard, passed away peacefully at his home in Palm Beach, Florida at the age of 98.
