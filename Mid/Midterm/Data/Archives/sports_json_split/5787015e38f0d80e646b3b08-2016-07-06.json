It is with great sadness that we mourn the passing of Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr., former President of Bronx Community College, who served his country with great distinction in World War II as one of the famed Tuskegee Airmen and later as a leading champion for civil rights. During his 17 years of exemplary service as president, Dr. Brown intensified the College's outreach to New York City's economic and educational institutions through partnerships with business and industry. With his leadership, new programs were developed in high growth professions in the fields of health, technology and human services. He later joined The City University of New York Graduate Center as University Professor and Director of the Center for Urban Education Policy. Dr. Brown for many years hosted \"African American Legends,\" a public affairs show produced by CUNY TV. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. William C.
