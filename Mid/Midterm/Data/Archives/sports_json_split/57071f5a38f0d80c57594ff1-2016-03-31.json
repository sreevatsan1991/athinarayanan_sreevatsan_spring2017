Loving husband for 39 years of Alice Freund Gottlieb. Beloved father of Caryn (Richard), Amy (Gary), Eric and Caroline (fiance Max) and grandfather of Eliza, Andrew and Samson. Bob graduated cum laude from Alfred University in 1963 and magna cum laude from Columbia University Law School in 1966, where he was an editor of the Columbia Law Review. He was a senior litigation partner at Rosenman & Colin, later Katten Muchin Rosenman. In retirement, Bob was a mediator, did pro bono work and attended classes, continuing his lifelong pursuit of learning. Bob loved spending time with Alice and his family, traveling, reading and following world events. He greatly enjoyed going to museums, listening to music and spending time in Central Park. For those that knew him well, it will be hard to pass a park bench without thinking of him. Bob's family is heart- broken at his passing and appreciates all of the friendship and support received during his illness. Burial will be private. The Gottlieb family will receive visitors at the Harmonie Club, located at 4 East 60th Street, on April 7 from 5:30 to 8:30pm. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the American Cancer Society. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-31T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GOTTLIEB, ROBERT WILLIAM"}, "print_page": "15", "snippet": "GOTTLIEB--Robert William, 74, of Manhattan, died peacefully on March 29, 2016 surrounded by his family.
