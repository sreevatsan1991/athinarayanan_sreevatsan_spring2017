A native New Yorker, he was born in the shadow of Washington Square and later moved to the Upper West Side with his parents. Classified 4-F by the Selective Service in World War II due to a defective heart valve, Donald sat out the conflict at Oberlin College, graduating in 1946. \"Having a desire to write but little creative talent, I decided to try journalism,\" he later wrote. He started with the daily Ossining Citizen Register as its only reporter and soon moved to the Pittsburgh Press, which published five editions a day. After working there for a few years, he concluded that the paper's courthouse coverage was weak and applied to law school, figuring he would return to newspapers upon graduation. In 1957 he completed his degree at Columbia University Law, graduating with honors. Unable resist the law's gravitational pull, he accepted a job with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and worked there from 1957 to 1984, largely representing public corporations. A senior partner with the firm, he was asked in 1984 to join senior management at Gulf + Western Industries, an early conglomerate that he had represented as outside counsel for 10 years. He served as Executive Vice President, Chief Counsel, and Chief Administrative Officer until the company, by then named Paramount Communications, Inc., was sold in 1994. He returned to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett after working for a year with Paramount's former board chairman, Martin Davis, who had started an investment boutique. Donald was a close advisor to late Movado Group founder Gedalio (Gerry) Grinberg and sat on the Movado Board for more than 25 years. Throughout his career, Donald's outside interests centered on the arts, literature, and libraries. He served for 25 years on the New York Landmarks Conservancy Board, including a term as chairman. In 2006 he was given the Conservancy's Chairman's Award. He served on numerous other boards, including the Library Company at Philadelphia, the Larchmont Library, the Morgan Library, the American Antiquarian Society, The Writers Room, the Roundabout Theatre Company, the Dictionary of American Regional English, Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, the Heye National Museum of the American Indian - New York, the Museum of the City of New York, the Library of America, the Academy of American Poets, the Grolier Club, the National Building Museum, the American Academy in Rome, the American Ballet Theatre, the Gainsborough Studios, the New Criterion, and the Yale Edition of the Boswell Papers. In 1948 Donald married social worker Patricia Perry, beginning a 67-year union that he called the smartest decision of his life. His private interests, other than reading and his wife's opinion, included a collection of 20th Century images of people reading: prints, drawings, photographs, oils, watercolors, sculptures, etc. His late mother Gertrude Bergel Oresman was assistant to the editor of The Theater Magazine, and his late father A. Louis Oresman, was an attorney, C.P.A., and a financial advisor for a number of privately held corporations. He is survived by his wife Patricia; his brother, Stephen B. Oresman (Darien, CT); two sons, Thomas P. Oresman (Kent, WA) and Craig P. Oresman (Los Lunas, NM); daughter, Alison Oresman Wilson (Bellevue, WA); seven grandchildren, two step-grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his older brother, Roger B. Oresman, of Manhattan, a longtime partner at the Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy law firm; an infant daughter, Eliza Lyn; and great-grandson, Donny Wade. A memorial will be held September 10, 2016.
