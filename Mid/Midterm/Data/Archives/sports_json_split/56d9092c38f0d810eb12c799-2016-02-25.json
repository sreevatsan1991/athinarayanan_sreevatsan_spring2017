Son of Joseph and Sarah (nee Hoffman) Greenhill, Ira was born and raised in New York City, where he attended Ethical Culture School, before decamping to Swarthmore College, from which he graduated in 1942 magna cum laude. Following graduation, Ira joined the US Army and served proudly during World War II, the Korean conflict and later in the Reserves, before retiring as a major. After World War II ended, he attended Columbia Law School on the GI Bill and then entered private practice in the profession that he loved in New York City for nearly six decades, first with his father and later for a time with two of his sons, as well as partners and colleagues. When not practicing law, Ira relished time spent as a highly accomplished woodworker and cabinetmaker, recreational tennis player, \"pretend\" golfer (as he put it) and scotch aficionado, dividing time between Rye, NY and Port St. Lucie, FL. Ira is survived by his beloved wife of 65 years, Elaine D. Greenhill (nee Maltzman), as well as his sons and daughters-in-law, Jonathan S. Greenhill, Zachary R. and Judy L. Greenhill, and Lincoln J. and Kelly M. Greenhill, and four grandchildren, Caitlin, Alexander, Hunter and Gavin. He was predeceased by his sister, Phyllis Meyerson. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Columbia Law School and Swarthmore College. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-02-25T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GREENHILL, IRA J."}, "print_page": "16", "snippet": "GREENHILL--Ira J.,94, attorney, died on February 21, 2016, in New York City.
