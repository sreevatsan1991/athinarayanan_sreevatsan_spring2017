Beloved wife of Igal and loving mother to Briana, she was the cherished daughter of the late Edward Niemaseck and the late Jean Zawyrucha Niemaseck. She leaves behind brothers Don (Nancy) and Ken (Ruth), sister Kimberly Ann, stepmother JoAnn Landi, beloved nieces and nephews and great-nieces and great-nephews. A graduate of Rutgers University Graduate School of Social Work, Barbara was proud to be a social worker and was passionate about her profession, sharing her knowledge and gifts with those in need. Barbara lived her life with love, compassion and energy. She brought the best of herself to everything she did and everyone she knew, and is remembered with love and respect by the many people whose lives she touched. She loved life and especially her husband and their pup, Kira. The family is grateful to the dedicated staff of St. Peter's University Hospital and the special friends who cared for Barbara in her final days. As she led her life, Barbara fought her cancer with courage, grace and dignity and will be deeply missed. The funeral will be private; a celebration of Barbara's life will be held at a later date.
