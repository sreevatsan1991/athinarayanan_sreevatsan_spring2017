Her parents came to this country as part of the wave of Russian Jews who emigrated in the mid 1920s. Her mother was 12 and came with two older sisters; her father, who was 18 and came with his sister, was taken in by a cousin who taught him to the printing trade.

She was a former board member of the Princeton Senior Resource Center and with her husband was a member of Community Without Walls, Friends of the Institute for Advanced Study, The Center for Jewish Life at Princeton University and the Princeton Jewish Center.
