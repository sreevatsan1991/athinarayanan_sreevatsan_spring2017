The NYU Community deeply mourns the loss of President Emeritus John Brademas, a great humanitarian, statesman, and educator whose vision and leadership helped to fundamentally transform this University. An Indiana native, John joined the US Navy officers training program after high school in 1945, was a Rhodes scholar, worked as an aide to Illinois governor and presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson, and taught political science at Notre Dame before going on to represent Indiana's Third Congressional District in Washington, D.C. for more than two decades, distinguishing himself as a champion of progressive legislation, education, and the arts. When he became the 13th President of NYU in 1981, it was a time of uncertainty for the University, which was only a few years removed from serious financial difficulties. But John did not shrink from the challenge: in 1984, he launched a major, transformative fundraising campaign that succeeded in raising more than $1 billion. He also oversaw the opening of a number of major campus programs and learning centers, including the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, the Casa Italiana Zerilli- Marimo, and the Center for Japan-US Business and Economic Studies. His presidency marked the start of NYU's transformation from a regional university to its present status as a nationally and internationally renowned scholarly and research institution - one of the great success stories in higher education. He continued to be active in public life after stepping down as president - he served as chair of President Clinton's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities and as a member of the New York State Board of Regents. Deeply interested in Spanish history and culture, he was the driving force behind the creation of the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center at NYU, which promotes research and scholarship on Spain and the Spanish- speaking world, and became the Center's first president. He served on NYU's Board of Trustees for 35 years. He was recognized by the University in 2001 with the Albert Gallatin medal, and the John Brademas Center for the Study of Congress was established at the NYU Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service in his honor. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Dr. Mary Ellen Brademas; his sister, Eleanor Brazeau; his stepchildren - Katherine Goldberg, Jane Murray, and John Briggs - and their children - James and Briggs Goldberg, Cameron and John Murray, and Alexandra and Molly Briggs - as well as all of his loved ones and friends. For his leadership, wisdom, dignity, commitment to service, and record of achievements, he will be sorely missed by the NYU community.
