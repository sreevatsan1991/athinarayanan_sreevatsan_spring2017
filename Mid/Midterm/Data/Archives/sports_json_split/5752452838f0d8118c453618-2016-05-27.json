The Downtown Alliance mourns the passing of our Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Bernstein, a former city official who played a significant role in shaping our vision and work for nearly two decades.

Before joining the Downtown Alliance, Bill was the First Deputy Executive Director of the New York City Department of City Planning for more than ten years. Prior to this, he worked for the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development's Rent Control Division and for the New York City Loft Board.
