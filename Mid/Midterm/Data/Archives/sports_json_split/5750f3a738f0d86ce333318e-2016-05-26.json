Died on May 21, 2016 in Westwood, Massachusetts at the age of 92, after a life devoted to her family and the important communities of her life. She died in her sleep with family present after a period of decline. Born in New York City, Sue was the daughter of Helen and Louis Carreau. She attended Rye Country Day School and graduated from Wellesley College in 1946, after which she worked at Time Life in New York City. She married Carl Mueller, an engineer turned banker, in 1948. Sue and Carl raised a family of five children in Ridgewood, New Jersey, then moved to Manhattan where they lived for thirty-two years. During her busy years in Ridgewood and continuing through the first decade of this century, Sue served on a number of boards and organizations in addition to her active role as wife and mother. She was a trustee of the Ridgewood Public Library, and then the New York Public Library where she helped to launch significant fundraising and other innovative initiatives. She served for many years as a trustee of Wellesley College where she led numerous fundraising efforts. Carl and Sue have been longtime summer residents and maintained a home on Nantucket Island.
