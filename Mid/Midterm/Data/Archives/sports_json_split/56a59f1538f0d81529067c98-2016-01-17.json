Diana E. Herzog (nee Rigby) 76, of New York City and Southport, CT, passed away from complications after a stroke, on Wednesday, January 13, 2016 at her residence. Diana was born on June 23, 1939, in Stoke-on-Trent, England, to Elinor (Ada Allen) and Reginald Rigby. Diana attended the Courtauld Institute, in London, earning a bachelor's degree. She then studied Medieval art in Frieburg, Germany, and later at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University where she achieved a Master's in Fine Art. Diana moved to New York City in 1963, and married John E. Herzog, whom she had met on a trip to Mexico two years before. Diana and John lived in Manhattan, where Diana taught English as a second language at the New School, telling her devoted students that the pilgrims celebrated the first Thanksgiving in Philadelphia! Diana and John moved to Brooklyn Heights in 1972, where they were active in the Heights Casino and Plymouth Church. They summered in Clinton Corners, NY, where visitors could admire large vegetable beds and beehives, and later in Madison, CT, in the beautifully restored \"Red Top,\" with its view of the Long Island Sound. Diana started her career in collectible financial documents at R.M. Smythe & Co., first researching obsolete and inactive securities and then branching out into the field of autographs as the firm expanded into a leading auction house. Diana was a formidable business woman, securing important consignments and putting collectors together with the items they sought. Diana personally assembled autographs of British royalty, writers and poets, acquiring the nickname \"Lady Di.\" Diana was active in the Junior League of Brooklyn, Resources for Children with Special Needs, and many industry organizations including as president of the Manuscript Society, and PADA. Diana enjoyed membership in the Cosmopolitan Club and the Grolier Club. Diana edited the magazine \"Friends of Financial History\" for many years, now published by the Museum of American Finance, which she and John nurtured for over 25 years. As world travelers, Diana and John explored together, spending time in Europe and Asia, bringing home artifacts and anecdotes as well as cherished contacts. Diana accompanied John on many securities industry trips, supporting John at Herzog, Heine, Geduld. Diana's love of art and opera, her linguistic talents, and her culinary skills were well known by her friends and family. Her tennis game was graceful, and she loved reading, especially British mysteries. Diana cherished her roots in England, visiting often to maintain close relationships with family and friends \"across the pond.\" Diana will be missed by all who knew her, and especially by her family, who are deeply saddened by her passing. Diana is survived by her husband of over 50 years, John; her daughters, Mary (Andy Davidoff) and Sarah Shine (Kevin); her cousins, Michael J. Rigby, (Ann Sheridan) Pat Sharrock, and Anne Grabaskey (Peter); and her grandchildren, Keith and Sophie Shine. Diana's family is extremely grateful to Genevee Thomas, Veronica Vernon, and Joylynn Thomas for the wonderful care they took of Diana during her long illness. A memorial service will be held at Trinity Episcopal Church, 651 Pequot Avenue, Southport, CT 06890, on Wednesday, January 20, 2016, at 3:00pm. A reception at the church will follow. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to The Pequot Library, 720 Pequot Avenue, Southport, CT 06890, where Diana loved to go, and helped create two exhibits. The Shaughnessey Banks Funeral Home, 50 Reef Rd. in Fairfield Center has been entrusted with the services.
