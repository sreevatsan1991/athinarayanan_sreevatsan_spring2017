He was 89 years old. Born December 19, 1926 in Montreal, Canada. He was the third of four sons of Sarah and Jacob Stober. Gerry was the beloved husband of Ruth (nee Benjamin), the adored father of Jill Lafer (Barry), Lori (deceased) and Clifford (Wendy) and loving grandfather of Joshua (Marissa), Peter, Casey, Haley and Sara. Beloved brother of Morton, Julius and David. Gerry was a brilliant and dedicated OB/GYN who practiced in Queens, NY. He attended McGill University and McGill Medical School and came to NY for his residency where he met Ruth in 1954 and married in 1955. In his life he was totally devoted to his family and to his patients. In 1976 he was the first obstetrician in New York State to perform a Caesarean Section with the husband present in the delivery room. Those who knew him in the operating room still talk about his tremendous surgical skills and his ability to teach his successors. He cared deeply about women's reproductive healthcare and took great pride in his daughter Jill's position as Board Chair of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. He was one of the founding physicians of Booth Memorial Medical Center, now New York Hospital of Queens. His patients adored him and there are many Gerrys and Geralds named after him. He was a man of determination, integrity, principles and dignity. He believed in mind, body and spirit and practiced this philosophy throughout his life. He horseback rode, skated, skied, played tennis and was often spotted jogging and biking through the streets of Great Neck. He retired in 1990 and traveled the world with his wife, Ruth and spent his time with his grandchildren. He was proud of his knowledge of Shakespeare, constantly quoting him as well as much of classical literature. He was a voracious reader and an astute investor, one of his talents and loves. He was a wordsmith and enjoyed studying the derivation of words and their meanings. His knowledge of history and literature were legendary in our family. He took cooking lessons and enjoyed cooking and wines. He loved the opera, hockey and a good dramatic play. Most of all, he had a great sense of humor and an appreciation and a love of life. He loved his jokes and repeated them often! He will be missed by his family and friends but his memory and life lessons will live on in our hearts forever.
