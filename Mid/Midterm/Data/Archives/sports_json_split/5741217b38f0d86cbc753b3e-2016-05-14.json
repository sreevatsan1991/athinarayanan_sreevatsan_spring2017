Bob was born in Brooklyn, NY on January 4, 1918 to David Lewis Sloane, DDS, and Sarah Kanterman Sloane and was preceded in death by his brother Theodore S. Sloane of Palm Beach, Florida. A graduate of James Madison High School, Class of 1938, Bob enrolled in a two-year accelerated college program at Alfred University prior to graduating NYU College of Dentistry in 1942. He started his dental practice in his father's office after coming home from World War II in 1946 after four years of service. He conducted a very successful practice in reconstructive dentistry on 69th Street across from his beloved Central Park. Bob brought a meticulous and artistic eye to his work, which was much admired by his patients and professional colleagues. An innovative thinker and problem solver, he embraced new technologies well into his 90s, staying engaged with life and the people around him, including grandchildren who helped keep him young. A wonderful storyteller with a keen sense of humor, he was easily able to engage those around him. Always an artist at heart, Bob reveled in many hours painting in his studio after finally retiring from dentistry in 1995 at age 79. He had an infectious charm and children were mesmerized by his magic tricks. His sense of fun was highly attuned as was his intellectual curiosity. He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Ann, and their children, Margaret of Washington DC, and Douglas and his wife, Esther, of New York, NY and two daughters by his first marriage to the former late Joan Lahm, Carol and her partner, Jim Bowers, of Maine, Adrienne of Massachusetts as well as grandsons, Asa Oines, Alex and Oliver Sloane of New York, NY; and Nicholas G.B. Sloane of Washington, DC. A memorial reception for friends and family will be held at Frank E. Campbell's Funeral Home on Saturday, May 14th from 2:30-4:30pm. Donations in Bob's memory may be made to the Central Park Conservancy in lieu of flowers. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  SLOANE, ROBERT BENEDICT DDS"}, "print_page": "08", "snippet": "SLOANE--Robert Benedict DDS, of Manhattan died peacefully at his home on May 10, 2016 at the age of 98.
