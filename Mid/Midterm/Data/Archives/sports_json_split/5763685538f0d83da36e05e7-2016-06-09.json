May 13, 1956 - May 30, 2016. After a brief, four-month struggle with stomach cancer, Ted died peacefully, with his wife Lisa at his bedside. To say he loved his family was an understatement--Ted lived and breathed for his daughter Daniela, and his wife and companion of nineteen years, Lisa. The only son of Marie and Theodore Weis, Ted was raised in New York and New Jersey. After graduating from Indiana University and Fordham University School of Law, he practiced as an entertainment attorney in his own firm and also worked with his wife in her clothing business. An easygoing, kind hearted and exceptionally funny man, Ted was happiest amongst his family and many longtime friends. He loved music, old monster movies, the Yankees and most of all, playing baseball and dodgeball with his daughter. He was deeply loved by those fortunate to be close with him, and he will be greatly missed. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-09T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WEIS, THEODORE"}, "print_page": "15", "snippet": "WEIS--Theodore.
