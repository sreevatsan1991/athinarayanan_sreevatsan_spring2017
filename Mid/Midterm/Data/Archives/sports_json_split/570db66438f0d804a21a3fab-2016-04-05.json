He was a gifted wordsmith who wrote ad copy and direct mail for Esquire, Scott Publishing, Family Media and Cowles Publishing, among others, from 1957 until his retirement in 2000; and exquisite daily emails to his son until the end of his life. He was a talented amateur violinist; a lover of classical music with a passion for Mahler and Heifetz; and a fan of good writing whether it was by Shakespeare, Updike or a young unknown. He adored a hearty meal paired with good drink, telling off-color jokes, and flirting with beautiful women, all of which he enjoyed until his final days.
