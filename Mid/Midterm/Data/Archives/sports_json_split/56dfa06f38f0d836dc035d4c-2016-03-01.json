Bob graduated from CCNY and from Fordham Law School in 1968. He began his legal career with Ernst & Ernst before he became an Assistant Corporation Counsel for the City of New York in its honors program. He then became associated with the Wormser Kiely law firm in 1969 and rapidly rose to partner in 1973. Bob engaged in a wide variety of practice areas on behalf of the firm, including litigation, corporate, commercial, real estate, fiduciary activities and individual counseling for domestic and foreign clients. At the time of his passing, he was a senior partner of the firm and its Deputy Managing Partner. After moving with his family from Westchester to Manhattan, Bob joined the Board of Directors of The Connaught, a large cooperative apartment building on East 54th Street, and was elected President of the Board, a position he held at the time of his death. Bob never allowed his busy professional practice or his Board activities to interfere with his unremitting devotion to his family and friends and his commitment to the game of golf with his longtime friends. Bob is survived by his loving wife Bonnie of 47 years, his son Marc and his wife Samantha, his daughter Jodi and her husband Thomas Sargent, and his wonderful grandchildren Luke, Emma, Simone and Arlo. He is also survived by his sister Helen's children, Michelle and Jeffrey and all of his nieces and nephews. Bob will be dearly missed by all who knew him but especially his beloved family who will have cherished memories of all the good times they had together. A funeral service will be held Tuesday at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, followed by interment. The family will sit Shiva at the family residence in Manhattan and at his son's residence in Westfield, NJ. In lieu of flowers and in recognition of Bob's many contributions to others, his leadership, talents and ready smile, donations in Bob's name may be made to MHO (Manhattan Hematology Oncology) Research Foundation, c/o Arlene Munoz: Donation Processing, 157 East 32nd Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10016. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-01T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  JACOBS, ROBERT F."}, "print_page": "13", "snippet": "JACOBS--Robert F.,71, of New York, NY, passed away peacefully at his home on February 27, 2016, surrounded by his loving family, following a courageous battle with cancer.
