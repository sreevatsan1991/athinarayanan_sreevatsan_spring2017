He was born in Newark, NJ, the youngest son of Herman and Rose Miller. A serial jokester he never revealed his generous, kind and loving side. Quietly and privately he took care of friends, family and employees in need. After graduating Weequahic High School, he joined the army as WWII was ending and the Korean war beginning. Taking his brother's advice he did not re-up and was honorably discharged. Using the GI Bill, he attended NYU and received a degree in Mechanical Engineering. After working for his brother for several years he went out on his own. Then he joined with two good and complimentary-minded men to form Miller Proctor Nickolas, a company that sold and serviced industrial and commercial heating products. Business associates described him as an innovator and having a strong business acumen, which helped MPN thrive and prosper. He was proud of what he had helped create and was sad to retire. Colleagues and employees were saddened to see him go. His company was family. Bud's real-time family fulfilled his life. In 1964, he married Patricia Breckir and they moved from NYC to Huntington, Long Island where they began raising a family. After 10 years they moved to Mt. Kisco, NY, where they lived for 28 years. He was a proud father and worked hard at being a good one, being generous, loving, a disciplinarian when necessary, and equally bragging when deserved. Upon raising their children, Bud and Pat retired to Ocean Reef, FL and Rockport, MA. Among friends he was one of the most loyal and honorable you could have. After fifty one years of marriage and many days with his loved ones and friends, fishing, playing tennis, exercising, tinkering, singing, riding his scooter, reading voraciously, napping in his chair, sending jokes via email, and vividly expressing his opinions he is survived by his wife, Pat, their three children Jane, (Bart), James, Luke (Jen), his five grandchildren, Olivia, Lily, Owen, Zaneta and Clementine, his nephews Michael and Richard and his \"girly\" Sugar the dog.
