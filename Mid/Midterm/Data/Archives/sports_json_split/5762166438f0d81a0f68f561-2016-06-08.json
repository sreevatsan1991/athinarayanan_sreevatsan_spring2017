Born in New York City to B.P. and Adeline Jaffe Schulberg, she moved with her parents and older brother Budd to Los Angeles, where her father was head of production at Paramount Studios. Sonya came to love sun, horses, dogs and Malibu, where Ad built one of the first houses. At the insistence of their mother, who had a literary agency in NYC from 1945 until 1977, Sonya, Budd and younger brother Stuart became writers. She attended The Progressive School, co-founded by her mother. After her parents' divorce, Sonya attended schools in Paris, Geneva and London. She started Sarah Lawrence but left at 19 when Scribners published her first novel (Maxwell Perkins was her editor). Budd's first novel, What Makes Sammy Run, made a bigger splash and Budd went on to success as a screenwriter (On the Waterfront). Sonya was married to attorney Ben O'Sullivan from 1941 until his death in 1998. Sadly, their son John O'Sullivan died in 2010. Her dear friends, brothers Budd and Stuart, also predeceased her. She is survived by other close friends: her daughter Dr. Chris O'Sullivan of NYC and Mamaroneck, Budd's and Stuart's children, among them Vicky Kingsland, Benn, Sandra, K.C., Peter and Jonathan Schulberg; her nieces Elizabeth Frank and Beth O'Sullivan; and her grandchildren Sarah and Kate O'Sullivan and great-grandson Will McCullough of Washington, DC and Betsy Schulberg. Wherever she lived, she adopted dogs and cats, tended wild animals, created gardens (on Martha's Vineyard and in Mamaroneck). She published short stories and recently completed a witty sad novel with perfectly constructed sentences about growing up in Hollywood. She was buried in the West Tisbury Cemetery on Martha's Vineyard. A reception will be held at her home in Mamaroneck in mid June. Sonya would have liked contributions to one of the many animal organizations she supported, including the Doris Day Animal Foundation, 8033 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 845, Los Angeles, CA 90046 or donate in memoriam online at DDAF. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-08T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  O'SULLIVAN, SONYA S."}, "print_page": "15", "snippet": "O'SULLIVAN--Sonya S.,98, died at her home in Mamaroneck on June 3.
