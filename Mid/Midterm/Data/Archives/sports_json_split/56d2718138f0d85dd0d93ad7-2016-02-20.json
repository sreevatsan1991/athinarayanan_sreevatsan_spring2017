The staff and trustees of Northwell Health mourn the loss of Life Trustee and past Chair of North Shore Health System Board of Trustees Robert Kaufman. A dedicated benefactor, Bob and his wife Florence supported a wide variety of programs at North Shore University Hospital (NSUH) which greatly contributed to the hospital's success. Thanks to the Kaufmans' foresight and support, the Florence and Robert Kaufman Conference Center was created at NSUH and serves as a focal point for news conferences, celebrations, and discussions of the latest medical advances as well as a place of instruction for the hospital's medical students, house staff, doctoral candidates and physicians. Bob's leadership, enthusiasm, commitment and generosity has helped Northwell remain steadfast in its mission to put patients first and make a difference in their lives by providing the highest quality healthcare available. The Florence and Robert Kaufman Professor of Medical Ethics was created at the Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine for this purpose; to provide our future doctors with the integrity to carry on our mission.
