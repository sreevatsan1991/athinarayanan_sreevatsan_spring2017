Her family, friends, and colleagues mourn the loss of Jane Baron Rechtman. A member of the faculty of The Masters School in the History and Religion Department until her retirement in 2014, Jane taught World Religions and other courses over her 23-year career. She served as acting chair of her department in 2003-04; she was appointed the Henry Sloane Coffin Chair of Religion in 2005 and received the Anna Howe Faculty Award in 2013. Jane also served as Dean for the Classes of 2009 and 2013. Through the Matters of Spirit program she stewarded faithfully for so many years, Jane ministered to the souls around her, infusing her spirit into the life of the School, sharing her life with her students and colleagues. Diagnosed with pancreatic cancer shortly before her retirement, Jane raised funds as well as the awareness of others in her efforts to combat the disease. Remaining active until the end, Jane defied the limitations of her illness, just as her love and compassion defied the darker moods of the soul. Jane is survived by her husband of 36 years, Neal, and her two sons, Jonathan and Joseph, none of whom could have asked for a better mate or mother.
