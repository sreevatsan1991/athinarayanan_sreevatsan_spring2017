The Anti-Defamation League mourns the loss of our dear friend and advisor, the Holocaust survivor, writer and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel. A Jewish voice of conscience for a generation who witnessed humanity's darkest hour, Wiesel was unrelenting in his pursuit for justice and memory for all victims of genocide. A committed Zionist, he spoke out unfailingly against anti-Semitism as a moral disease that could lead to the dissolution of societies and civilization. He was an early recipient of ADL's Joseph Prize for Human Rights; and, along with his wife, Marion, accepted the ADL Jabotinsky Prize for Courageous Jewish Leadership. \"Anti-Semitism,\" he once said, \"is an attack not only on the Jewish people. It is an attack on all people.\" We extend our deepest condolences to the entire family. Marvin D. Nathan National Chair Jonathan A. Greenblatt CEO and National Director Abraham H.
