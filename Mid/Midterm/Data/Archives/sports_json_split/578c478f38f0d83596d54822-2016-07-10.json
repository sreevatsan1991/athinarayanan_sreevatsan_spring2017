The Board of Directors, Overseers and staff of the International Rescue Committee are deeply saddened by the loss of Elie Wiesel, Holocaust survivor and memory keeper of the victims of Nazi persecution who used his moral authority as a Nobel Laureate to focus attention on global atrocities and the plight of refugees. He was a longtime supporter of the IRC, an organization founded in 1933 to aid victims of the Nazis, joining the IRC Board in 1985 and the IRC Overseers in 2004. Before joining the IRC Board, Mr. Wiesel was a member of the IRC's Citizens Commission on Indochinese Refugees--a group whose advocacy work helped lead to the passing of the U.S. Refugee Act of 1980. In 1980, Commission members visited a Cambodian refugee camp, where Mr. Wiesel explained, \"I came here because nobody came when I was there. One thing that is worse for the victim than hunger, fear, torture, is the feeling of abandonment, the feeling that nobody cares, the feeling that you don't count.\" In 1987, the IRC honored Mr. Wiesel with the Freedom Award, presented by Liv Ullmann, for his \"extraordinary service to humanity, freedom and the cause of refugees.\" We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family.
