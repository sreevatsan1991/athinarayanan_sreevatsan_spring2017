Robert Miller Fisher, a proud 90-year-old, passed away peacefully on March 1, 2016, in the home he loved, in the building in which he lived for 77 years. Adored and devoted son of Jeanette and Samuel, beloved and treasured husband of Linda (Wax) for 55 years, loving and caring father to Helaine (Bob Hebble) and Lawrence (Susan Gavay), Bob was thrilled to be \"Poppy\" to his grandchildren Cole, Zoe, Will and Remi. They gave him great pleasure, and he was enormously proud of their achievements. Bob was an attorney for over 50 years with the firm of Fisher, Hecht and Fisher, started by his father in the 1920s. He practiced business law and was also a U.S. Bankruptcy Court Trustee. He had an impeccable reputation--for honesty and integrity. During his life, Bob was a member of the Young Men's Philanthropic League, the West Side Democratic Club, the Commercial Law League of America, the Bankruptcy Bar, and Congregation Shaare Zedek, where he sat in his father's seat for many years. He loved golf, his Tuesday night poker games, and all sports (except boxing). He loved his country, and he loved Israel. Bonds for Israel honored him for his devotion to the state of Israel and commitment to its Bond Program. Bob was a generous man, a good friend and confidante, and one who always stood up for what he believed to be right. He was a mensch. The family is grateful to Dr. Leonard Mattes, Dr. David Harnick, Dr. Daniel Popowich, and Dr. Steven Naymagon, not just for their expertise but for their kindness and caring as well. His nurses Aileen, Jillian, Liane, and Maricel tended to his every need with warmth and a smile. The family would appreciate donations in Bob's memory to Hatzoloh, c/o The Jewish Center, 131 West 86th Street, New York, NY 10024. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-03-06T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  FISHER, ROBERT M"}, "print_page": "26", "snippet": "FISHER--Robert M.
