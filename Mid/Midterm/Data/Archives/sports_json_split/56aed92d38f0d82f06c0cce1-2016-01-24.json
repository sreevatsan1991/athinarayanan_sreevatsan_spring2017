Robert Dayton, whose career spanned decades in support of a vibrant downtown Minneapolis, MN, died on January 17th. He was 73 years old. A great-grandson of the founder of Daytons, Bob carried on the family retail and community-oriented legacy. After graduating from Yale in 1964, Bob joined what was to become Dayton Hudson and then Target, rising to become General Merchandise Manager and then Vice President of Stores. While with Daytons, Bob attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School. A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers. In 1977 Bob left Daytons and purchased Harold, an upscale specialty store for women. Working together with his wife Joanie, Bob restored its iconic status as a Minneapolis retail institution. In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. In addition, Bob served as a Trustee of the Blake School, Carlton College, and the University of Minnesota Foundation. In 1994 Bob founded and was later named Chair Emeritus of the Mentoring Partnership of Minnesota. Bob grew up in Wayzata, Minnesota and attended Blake, Eaglebrook, and Taft. While at Yale, Bob met his wife Joanie, then attending Skidmore College, on a blind date at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. They were married in 1964 and had three boys. Bob enjoyed a number of hobbies, but none more so than golf. Beginning at Woodhill Country Club, his passion eventually extended east to Pine Valley and west to Cypress Point. He cofounded Spring Hill Golf Club and enjoyed playing in the U.S. Seniors. Bob will always be remembered for his warm heart, wonderful smile, infectious laughter, fantastic sense of humor, and tremendous spirit. He is survived by Joanie, his wife of 51 years, two brothers, three sons, and seven grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on February 18th at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-24T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DAYTON, ROBERT"}, "print_page": "19", "snippet": "DAYTON--Robert.
