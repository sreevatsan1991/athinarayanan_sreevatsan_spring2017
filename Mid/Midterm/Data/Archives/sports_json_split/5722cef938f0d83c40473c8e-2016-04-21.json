Died peacefully at home in Spencertown, New York, on April 3 at 95 years old. He is survived by his loving wife of 55 years, Mimi Levin Lieber; children Janno, James, Theo and Angie; daughters-in-law Amy Glosser, Leah Lieber and Deborah Levitt; son-in-law Matthew Sussman; and 10 grandchildren. Born January 30, 1921 in The Netherlands, the only child of Zygmunt Lieber of Krakow and Gabriele Lifczis of Vienna, he was raised in Vienna, Antwerp and Brussels, and attended Frensham Heights School in England. A student at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles when the Nazis invaded Belgium in May 1940, he fled via France and Spain to Morocco before arriving in New York in mid-1941. Charles served in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1946, finishing as a second lieutenant. His mother was deported from France to Auschwitz in 1942, while his father and stepmother spent the war in today's Mozambique. Charles received a B.A. from The New School in 1948. He then worked at Knopf Publishing and headed the college department at Random House until 1964, when he bought academic textbook publisher Atherton Press, later merging it to form Aldine Atherton. In 1980, he acquired Hebrew Publishing Company, the oldest American publisher of Judaica. He was a member of the Lenox Hill Democratic Club and a candidate for State Assembly in 1960. In July 1960, Charles married Mimi Levin. They raised their four children on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Charles was active in many different organizations, including as leader of the Reconstructionist Foundation and the West Side Jewish Community Council. At various times he served on the boards of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, the Chatham Synagogue, Close Encounters with Music in the Berkshires and St. Ann's School in Brooklyn. Charles was a lover of language, music, books, pipes, coffee, Central European cooking, and friendship. He enjoyed connecting with everyone he met from whatever walk of life - when possible, in their native language - and whatever age. He was loved and admired by many - especially his family. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-04-21T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  LIEBER, CHARLES D"}, "print_page": "27", "snippet": "LIEBER--Charles D.
