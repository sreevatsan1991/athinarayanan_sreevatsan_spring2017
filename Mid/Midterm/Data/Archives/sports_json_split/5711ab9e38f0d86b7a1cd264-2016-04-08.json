Jack's favorite time of the year was opening weekend of the golf season at Noyac Golf Club, Sag Harbor, NY, where he was a valued member since 1982. Known for his wit and generosity among family, friends, golf buddies and staff and patrons of his restaurants, genius storyteller and master of zingers, you always knew exactly where you stood with Jack.
