Dr. Corwin was board certified in internal medicine and cardiology and was a Fellow of the American College of Physicians and American College of Cardiology. He was an extraordinarily dedicated physician who practiced in Westwood and was an attending physician at Pascack Valley Hospital for over 30 years. He was much loved by his patients and highly respected by the medical community. He read voraciously and had an intense intellectual curiosity. He was also an accomplished artist and organist and an avid gardener. He loved his Dalmatians and enjoyed world travel with Dorothy. He continued to study medicine daily throughout his 20-year retirement so that he could always \"give good advice\" to his family and friends. The family is honoring his wish for a private funeral service at Cedar Park Cemetery in Paramus, NJ.
