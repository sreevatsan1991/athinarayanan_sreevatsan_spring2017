Beloved husband of Mairuth (Hirsch) Feld and the late Doris (Rabinor) Feld. Loving father of Elaine S. Feld of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, stepfather of Kevin (Lisa) Maloney of Cary, North Carolina and devoted grandfather of Christopher Maloney and Kristina Maloney. Adored uncle by several generations of nieces and nephews. Long time resident of New City, NY, he was a real estate developer and community leader active in numerous charitable organizations in the area. A warm and generous man, happiest hosting lively family gatherings. Interested in social justice with a soft spot for the underdog. He never thought a woman's place was (solely) in the kitchen- so, he'd want you to think before you vote in 2016!! Funeral services at Menorah Funeral Chapel, 2145 Richmond Ave., Staten Island, NY at 1:00pm on Monday, April 25, 2016.
