She is survived by her beloved husband of 60 years, Laurence C. Leeds, Jr. (Larry) and her devoted daughters, Ashley Leeds (Christopher Harland) and Tracy Leeds (Evan Marwell). She was predeceased by her son Laurence C. Leeds, III (Cary) and her brother Oded Benary. Also surviving are her six adoring grandchildren: Samuel, Michael, and Benjamin Harland and Nicholas, Olivia, and James Marwell. Dalia, the daughter of Zvi and Belina Benary, was born in Tel Aviv. She attended school in Switzerland and English Girls College (El Nasr Girls' College) in Alexandria, during an era when young Jewish students from what was going to be the state of Israel crossed the border to attend school in Egypt. After visiting the United States several times, she moved to New York City where she met and married Larry on October 16, 1955. Dalia was a fine painter and sculptor and, during her early days in The United States, worked at the Art Students League and attended the Traphagen School of Design. Dalia became a legendary figure of the New York social scene. Her extraordinary beauty and grace, along with her wonderfully warm and sensitive personality, charmed almost everyone she met. She was kind and compassionate and, as a result of these attributes, she had an unending number of admirers and friends. After the tragic loss of her son Cary, she worked tirelessly and successfully to help build the Cary Leeds Center for Tennis & Learning, dedicated to improving the lives of thousands of young girls and boys in the Bronx. Dalia also served on the boards of The Council for a Beautiful Israel, the Israel Anti Drug Abuse Foundation, and The American Friends of the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra. Dalia never forgot her roots and loved her native Israel. She would travel there at least twice a year until her recent illness. It is the end of an amazing life. A private family service will be held graveside. The family will be sitting Shiva Sunday, May 1st, Monday, May 2nd, and Tuesday, May 3rd from 5:00pm - 8:00pm at their residence in New York City. A memorial service in celebration of Dalia's life, will be held at a future date. In lieu of flowers, donations in Dalia's name may be directed to the Cary Leeds Center for Tennis & Learning and sent to The New York Junior Tennis League, 58-12 Queens Blvd, Woodside, NY 11377.
