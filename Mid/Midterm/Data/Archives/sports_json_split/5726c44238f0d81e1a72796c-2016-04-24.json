Jackie Carter, a children's book editor and published author who epitomized wit, creativity and elegance, died Wednesday, April 13, in New York City following a graceful and valiant battle against lymphoma. Jackie begin her publishing career at Sesame Street before joining Scholastic in 1985 as Editorial Director of the Early Childhood Division. For more than 10 years, Jackie helped direct the editorial content of Scholastic's highly successful early childhood curriculum programs. Later Jackie joined Disney's Global Children's Book Division and created a new approach to reference and nonfiction books by using Disney characters, including the Winnie-the-Pooh Nature Encyclopedia, to help readers of all ages learn about the world around them. While still at Disney, Jackie assumed the role of Editorial Director of Jump at the Sun, an award winning imprint celebrating African American culture. Jackie published a wide range of titles, including Whoopi Goldberg's Sugar Plum Ballerina series, and the Willimena series by best-selling author Valerie Wilson Wesley. Jackie returned to Scholastic in 2004, and published popular non-fiction series, including A Wicked History and Mythlopedia. Jackie also worked in partnership with acclaimed scholar Dr. Alfred W. Tatum on the reading and writing program \"ID: Voice, Vision, Identity,\" aimed at building self-esteem and pride in disengaged African American males. Jackie was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2002. To help other women, Jackie created the \"It Girl's Guide to Chemo,\" a photo exhibit that depicted her 2002 battle with the illness and the challenges of dealing with chemotherapy. No one who met Jackie was untouched by her humor, her humanity, her kindness, the depth of her generosity and her unending love. Jackie is without equal, and the depth by which she will be missed is also without equal. Jackie is survived by her husband, Barry M. Herbold, of Kinderhook and New York City; her sister, Dr. Sharon Carter of New York, her step- children, as well as aunts and uncles, cousins and innumerable friends. A memorial service for Jackie's countless friends and associates will be conducted in New York City at a date to be announced.
