Leader in Academic Pediatrics: Born May 20, 1923, died January 22, 2016. Laurence Finberg, a pediatrician and scientist, was known for his contributions to the management of salt and water balance in children. He served as Chair of Pediatrics at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Downstate in Brooklyn from 1982- 1994, and was Dean of the School of Medicine at SUNY Downstate from 1988-1991. A native of Chicago, Dr. Finberg received an SB (1944) and MD degree (1946) from the University of Chicago. In August, 1950 during a major epidemic of poliomyelitis, when he was the Admitting Officer for Contagious Diseases at Baltimore City Hospitals, he took the bold step of integrating previously segregated medical services by admitting an African American adult to previously all white wards, breaking the color barrier. Dr. Finberg served on the faculty at Johns Hopkins from 1951-1963. He became Chair of Pediatrics at Montefiore Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1963. After moving to San Francisco in 1995, he continued to teach Pediatrics, serving on the faculty of both Stanford and UCSF medical schools. Dr. Finberg was beloved by medical students and residents and as teacher and served as a role model for countless young physicians and aspiring physicians. His work led to life-saving treatment for children, especially children from disadvantaged backgrounds all over the world, who have been the victims of dehydration. Dr. Finberg was Chair of the Academy of Pediatrics Committees on Nutrition and Environmental Hazards. An expert in the diagnosis and treatment of lead poisoning in children, he promoted the idea of testing the environment (obtaining lead levels in paint and other areas in the environment), rather than waiting to find high levels in the blood of children. His arguments against \"using children as the canaries in the coal mine,\" changed the emphasis and undoubtedly prevented disease in many children exposed to peeling paint and poor housing conditions. A gentle man, he was incredibly devoted to his friends and family, and will be remembered for his good natured sense of humor that lightened all occasions. In addition to being a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, he is remembered by his family and friends for his love of chocolate, travel, good wines, and the Chicago Cubs. He is survived by his wife of 20 years, Joann Quane-Finberg, his children Robert W. Finberg, Jeanne Finberg, James M. Finberg, their spouses Joyce, Robert, Melanie, and many loving grandchildren and great-grand children. His first wife, Harriet Levinson Finberg, died in 1994 after 49 years of marriage. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-31T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  FINBERG, LAURENCE"}, "print_page": "25", "snippet": "FINBERG--Laurence, MD.
