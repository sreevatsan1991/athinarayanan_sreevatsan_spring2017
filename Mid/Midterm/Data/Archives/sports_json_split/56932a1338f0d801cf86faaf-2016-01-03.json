Peter T. Manicas, retired professor of philosophy at Queens College, City University of New York and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, passed away on December 27 in Honolulu. He is survived by his wife of fifty-five years, Kenoe Kauanoe 'Ti' Manicas, and their son Teddy (Theodore). Their daughter Tautasi died previously. Born into a Greek and Sicilian immigrant family in Binghamton, NY, Manicas was raised in Batavia, NY. He saw active service in the U.S. Air Force in the late 1950s and attained the rank of Captain. He received his BA from Syracuse University, and his MA from the University of Buffalo and his PhD in philosophy from SUNY Buffalo (1963). Professor Manicas moved to Hawaii in 1988 where he served as Professor of Sociology and Director of the Interdisciplinary Studies program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (1988-2011). Early in his career he taught at C.W. Post College and Ohio Wesleyan University. A testimony to his scholarly productivity, Manicas published thirteen books and over fifty papers on realist philosophy, American pragmatism, and social theory including: \"The Death of the State\" (1974); \"A History and Philosophy of the Social Sciences\" (1987); and \"A Realist Philosophy of Science\" (2006). The consistent recipient of teaching awards, Manicas touched the lives of thousands of students. Peter was endowed with a fiery passion for social justice and had a curious mind, a wicked humor, and an open heart. A consummate epicure, he also was an enthusiastic fan of the New York Yankees, Knicks, and Giants, in addition to being a powerful presence in pick-up basketball. Peter was in many ways larger than life and will be irreplaceable. Services will be held at Borthwick Mortuary in Honolulu. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-03T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  MANICAS, PETER T"}, "print_page": "18", "snippet": "MANICAS--Peter T. 1934-2015.
