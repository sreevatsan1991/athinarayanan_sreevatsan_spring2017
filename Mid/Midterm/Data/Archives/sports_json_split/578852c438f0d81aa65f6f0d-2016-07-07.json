The Gutterman Family, The Board of Directors and all the Employees of Gutterman's Funeral Home and Gutterman-Warheit Memorial Chapel mourn the loss of our Esteemed and Beloved Mother and CEO. She was a very strong willed woman who was never afraid to speak her mind or help someone in need. She was a female pioneer in the nursing profession for over 40 years before becoming involved in the funeral industry. She was instrumental in growing the company to what it has become today, one of the largest family owned and operating Jewish Funeral Homes in the country. Her dedication to her job, patients and family were second to none. She will always be remembered for her quick wit, great memory, class and generosity. She cared so very much about everyone and was truly interested in everything that her family and friends were involved with. She will be greatly missed and remembered every day by all who had the privilege to know her and love her. Rest in Peace. Services Thursday, July 7, 12 noon at Gutterman's, 8000 Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury, NY. There will be a memorial service in Florida at a later date. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-07-07T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  GUTTERMAN, SHIRLEY"}, "print_page": "17", "snippet": "GUTTERMAN--Shirley.
