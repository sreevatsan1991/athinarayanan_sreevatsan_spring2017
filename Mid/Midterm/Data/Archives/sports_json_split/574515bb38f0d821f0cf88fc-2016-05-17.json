The Hofstra community is deeply saddened by the passing of President Emeritus Dr. James M. Shuart on May 13, 2016. Dr. Shuart was Hofstra's seventh president, serving from 1976 to 2001. There are few people who shared a more profound bond with Hofstra University, or had a more profound impact on the Hofstra community, than Dr. Shuart - as a student, an alumnus, a faculty member, an administrator and finally, as the University's longest-serving president. Under his leadership, Hofstra grew and expanded in many ways: enrollment increased; academic offerings and library holdings more than doubled; athletics grew to Division I status; our internationally respected presidential conferences began; new facilities, buildings and wings were constructed that more than doubled the University's physical space; the School of Communication was founded; and Hofstra became the first private university campus in the nation to be fully accessible to the physically challenged. In 2002 Hofstra Stadium was named in Dr. Shuart's honor. Dr. Shuart was also a dedicated public servant, serving as Nassau County commissioner of social services and deputy Nassau County executive from 1971 to 1975. He was recognized with Hofstra's Alumni Achievement and Alumnus of the Year awards, as well as the Long Island Association Medal of Honor. To honor the memory of Dr. Shuart, all University flags were lowered to half-staff. Alan J.
