He was born in Philadelphia, PA on February 26, 1986 to Thomas B. O'Brien, Jr. and Federica F. O'Brien. Brennan graduated from Moorestown High School and went on to receive a Bachelor of Science from the University of Richmond. He was married to Allison Sottile on November 8, 2014 in Lake Placid, NY.
