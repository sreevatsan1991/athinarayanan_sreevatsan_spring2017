Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, John left the Midwest for Princeton University, which he loved and where he was \"Nuz\" to his many treasured friends from the Class of '62. After graduating from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, John had a long and distinguished career in credit risk management at Chase Manhattan Bank, where he worked until he retired from his Senior Vice President role in 2003. John settled in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which he happily called home for 45 years. As often as he could, however, John escaped the city for the peace and beauty of the Adirondacks, where his home away from home, Big Shanty, is located near the top of Garnet Hill. Wherever he was, John was a devoted father and the much loved \"Gramps\" to his grandchildren. Beyond career and family, John enjoyed cheering on his beloved Princeton Tigers basketball and football teams, listening to classical and jazz music, solving the NYTimes crossword puzzles every day, and reading for his book club. He also valued his role as a member of both the NYU Lutheran Medical Center Board of Trustees and the Adirondack Architectural Heritage Board of Directors. John is survived by his four children, Kimberly Nuzum, Courtney Jimenez, Leah Ervi, and Jonathan Nuzum, and seven grandchildren, Ruby and Jake Lippert, Isa and Carlos Jimenez, Stella and Milo Ervi, and Illianna Hye Seul Lee Nuzum. He is also survived by his cherished sons- in-law, Aaron Lippert, Alexander Jimenez, and Tomi Ervi, and daughter-in-law, Kyoung Sook Suh. He was predeceased by his older sister, Constance Hall. A memorial service will be held at Grace Church in Brooklyn Heights on September 10, 2016 at 1:00, with a reception to celebrate his life at the Montauk Club in Park Slope. In lieu of flowers, donations in John's memory can be made to the Lutheran Medical Center or the Adirondack Architectural Heritage. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-06-25T00:00:00Z", "news_desk": "Classified", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  NUZUM, JOHN MARTIN, JR."}, "print_page": "19", "snippet": "NUZUM--John Martin, Jr.,76, beloved father, grandfather, friend, and neighbor, died on June 21, 2016, after a brief but difficult illness.
