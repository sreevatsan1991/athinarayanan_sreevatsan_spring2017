He was a retired economist and researcher who worked at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for 34 years. Born in Poland in 1929, he escaped to Great Britain in 1945 and lived in London where he received his Bachelor's degree from the London School of Economics. He immigrated to the United States in 1952. He received his Master's degree from Columbia University. He was devoted to the history of Poland and the country's fight with communism during the Cold War. After his retirement, he wrote extensively about this subject and was published in various Polish periodicals. He was an avid traveler who visited many countries throughout the world. He enjoyed the culture, architecture, wine and local cuisine everywhere he went. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Marta, his daughter Izzy Povich, son-in-law Andrew Povich, grandchildren Molly and Benjamin, his brother Adam Rudzki, his sister-in-law Zena Rudzki and his niece Ariana Rudzki. His remains will be laid to rest at a later date in Poland.
