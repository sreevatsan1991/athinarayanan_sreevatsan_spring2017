Devoted husband of the late Reverend Elsie Smith, beloved father of Jean Smith (and Rodnie Nelson), Howard Smith, Jr. (and Pamela Hakim) and Lilla Smith (and Dale Goncher). Proud grandfather of Christopher, Hannah and Natalie. A lifelong resident of Brooklyn, he graduated from Choate and Princeton University.

He joined the Board of Lutheran Medical Center, now NYU Lutheran Medical Center, in 1963 and was elected chairman in 1966. Among many significant accomplishments, he spearheaded the move and expansion of Lutheran Medical Center to a converted factory building and facilitated the creation of the Sunset Park Family Health Center, which grew into one of the largest community health centers in the country. Under the aegis of LMC, he managed the creation of Shore Hill, a rent subsidized apartment complex for senior citizens and later Harbor Hill, another facility for the elderly. He oversaw the development of Lutheran Augustana Center for Extended Care and Rehabilitation adjacent to Lutheran Medical Center and established Health Plus PHSP, provider of community based health and medical services. In 2004 he retired as Chairman after more than 41 years of leadership.

Additionally, he organized and served as the chairman of the United Lutheran Appeal for six years and was an active member of the Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd for over 75 years.
