Stunned by the bitter winds that swirled around Bryn Mawr College during the winter of 1958, Grace van Hulsteyn and her college friend Betsy Nelson crouched a colorful wool contraption that fit over the nose and was secured at the back of the head. Fellow classmates asked for examples and eventually the devices caused a bit of stir in ever widening circles until one of the apogees of pop culture stardom in the 1950s, the TV show What's My Line, got wind (so to speak) of the phenomenon and the young inventors appeared on the March 23, 1958 broadcast.

Grace pursued many interests: ceramics, law practice, french horn, living in Rome, travel, working on her beloved barn and property in Cochecton, NY.

Her family and friends wish her to rest in peace, though she hated to rest. May she toil and tinker in peace.
